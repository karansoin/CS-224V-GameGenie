Your dashes automatically refill when you change rooms, no matter whether you are mid-air or not; as such, you'll need to exploit this to ensure that [Madeline](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Madeline) collects the [crystal heart](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart). Upon boosting upwards sufficiently so you can grab onto the wall at the up-right corner of the screen in the first room (the one with the campfire), climb upwards. The second room that follows has no platform; climb upwards, then dash upwards as soon as your stamina falls to zero; [neutral jumps](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Neutral_jumps) also work. After making it upwards to a third room, dash up-leftwards; as soon as you fall back into the 2nd room, dash back up again so you re-enter the room you want to be in. At the left of the aforementioned 3rd room is a wall; latch onto it and climb up. The Crystal Heart awaits for you above.\n\n## Cassette Tape\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=2) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nAfter unlocking the Dream Blocks (after shattering the mirror), head back towards the central room you initially were in; all the previously deactivated dream blocks are now functional. You'll want to head to the bottom of said room, at the center; a dream block is placed in the floor. Dash downwards, and head to the room below: that room is a cassette room. Collecting the cassette unlocks [2B](https://celeste.ink/wiki/2B).\n\n## Strawberries\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\n### Start\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=4) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\nThere are 9 Strawberries found in this subchapter (not including the Golden Strawberry which spawns in the first room).\n\n#### Berry 1\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=5) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=5)\\]\n\nThis strawberry is found in the same room as the mirror, but out of view without the use of binoculars. To reach it, you need to stay on the falling platform in the previous room and then go right into a hidden gap which allows you to grab the berry.\n\n#### Berry 2\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=6) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=6)\\]\n\nIn the eighth room (to the top-left of the mirror room), this strawberry can be found in a hidden area above the middle of the 3 dream blocks, which you can dash upward through said dream block to reach.\n\n#### Berry 3\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=7) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=7)\\]\n\nThis will be the first seeded strawberry of the game. To collect these berries, do not touch the floor before collecting all of the strawberry seeds. The room where it's found is a tall room accessed from the upper two left transitions in the fourth room. Keep yourself airborne by dashing into any nearby dream blocks as they move and you can get all the seeds.\n\n#### Berry 4\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=8) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=8)\\]\n\nIn a room below the previous berry's room (past a smashable wall on the floor), or from the bottom left transition in the fourth room, this strawberry will be simple if approached from the former route. It is possible to get the distance to grab this berry from below, but you should be smashing the floor in the room above to access it with no challenge.\n\n#### Berry 5\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=9) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=9)\\]\n\nIn the fourth room, this strawberry must be carefully approached. It is hovering in the upper area surrounded by many spikes. To collect it, position yourself to diagonally dash downward into the area it's in, then either quickly dash straight upward or grab the wall, then dash straight upward to be in the safety to collect the strawberry.\n\n#### Berry 6\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=10) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=10)\\]\n\nBy going to the transition right of where the previous berry is located, the 6th berry is seen. Dash upward diagonally to land yourself on the traffic light block and then dash directly right so you'll be stopped while the traffic light block is also stopped on the right. Dash from there to the strawberry and climb up to safety.\n\n#### Berry 7\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=11) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=11)\\]\n\nTo the room right of the previous berry's room is where this strawberry is found. The safest approach is to dash right after jumping into the dream block, then dashing diagonally upward into the next and then grabbing the wall. After collecting the strawberry, climb higher and then dash left twice through the dream blocks to make it back.\n\n#### Berry 8\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=12) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=12)\\]\n\nHidden in the floor of berry 6's room is a transition. Line yourself up with the hole and dash straight down to get in. This will take you to a hidden tunnel above a previous room which contains this strawberry.\n\n#### Berry 9\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=13) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=13)\\]\n\nThis strawberry is found by backtracking to the second room and going straight up the dream block to then go right and arrive above the third room. To collect the berry, dash directly right into the upper dream block and then the lower one. Climb up to get the berry, then dash left twice and climb the wall as you return to claim the strawberry.\n\n### Intervention\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=14) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=14)\\]\n\nThere are 8 strawberries found in this subchapter.\n\n#### Berry 10\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=15) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=15)\\]\n\nIn the second room, this strawberry forces you to detour from the exit by going up-right from the dream block. For the most consistent collect, dash right into the berry, climb up and wait a bit, then jump back left.\n\n#### Berry 11\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=16) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=16)\\]\n\nIn the third room, you can see this strawberry inside a wall but with no real way to get it. In order to reach this area, dash straight left from the right side of the dream block just above the spikes. To make sure Badeline doesn't hit you, grab the berry and cling to the right wall, then dash to the left wall when she approaches and escape like normal.\n\n#### Berry 12\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=17) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=17)\\]\n\nIn the sixth room, the berry is located in the top-left corner. Dash up one side of the wall, jump to the other side and grab the strawberry, and slide down the wall.\n\n#### Berry 13\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=18) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=18)\\]\n\nFrom the seventh room, you can notice an opening in the ceiling between 2 walls filled with spikes. Try to get yourself under the second dream block in the room, then dash straight up and move left a bit before dashing straight up again. From there you can get into the room above and collect this strawberry.\n\n#### Berry 14\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=19) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=19)\\]\n\nIn the seventh room, this strawberry is very tricky to get because you can't interact with the falling platform above it or else it will block off the berry or crush you. Try your best to grab onto the walls elevated above spikes and climb them to jump into the pit with the berry, then quickly dash out and finish the room.\n\n#### Berry 15\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=20) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=20)\\]\n\nIn the eighth room, you can approach this berry differently depending on if you take the shortcut mentioned earlier. If you do take this shortcut, simply move right from your fall and into the hole where this strawberry is floating to collect it. If you don't, it's still possible to get this strawberry. When you approach the large, square-shaped dream block, dash through it diagonally up-right and then dash straight up to reach the berry.\n\n#### Berry 16\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=21) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=21)\\]\n\nFrom the eleventh room, you can access a screen transition at the top in the same column as the fourth dream block from the left. In the room above, dash straight up to find the strawberry and move left and right, dashing through the dream block as you descend, to avoid your death.\n\n#### Berry 17\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=22) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=22)\\]\n\nFrom the eleventh room, another screen transition can be found in the same column as the fourth dream block from the right. It's at the bottom, so to enter it you just have to dash straight down from the top of the dream block. In the room below, you can make it to the strawberry by dashing diagonally up-right from below both dream blocks. Once you get to the berry, do the same but mirrored to return.\n\n### Awake\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=23) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=23)\\]\n\n#### Berry 18\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=24) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?action=edit&section=24)\\]\n\nIn the sixth room, the hole in the ceiling still exists and can be entered. Another room must be scaled and then is a room with the winged strawberry. Jump onto the left spring and then move right in the air and jump across the disappearing platforms to the other spring. Climb the right wall after bouncing on this spring and jump left on the other disappearing platforms. To reach the winged strawberry, you actually need to dash into it. Aim for slightly higher than where the berry hovers as it will start flying up when you dash.\n\nRetrieved from \" [https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old\\_Site/Collectables?oldid=10260](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site/Collectables?oldid=10260)\"\n\n[Category](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Special:Categories):\n\n- [Chapters' collectables](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Category:Chapters%27_collectables)\n\nCookies help us deliver our services.

The subchapter introduces Chapter 2's main gimmick\u2014 space blocks. They first appear unpowered before appearing powered everywhere else after reaching the subchapter's cutscene. [Badeline](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Badeline) is first seen in the game in the shattered mirror cutscene breaking into her physical form. [Strawberry Seeds](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Collectibles) appear here for the first time as well. The [Crystal Heart](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_Heart_Guide) of Chapter 2 and the [Cassette](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Cassette_Guide) to unlock Chapter 2's B-Side can both be obtained in this subchapter.\n\n## **Gameplay**\\[\\]\n\nStarting off, the space blocks are all deactivated and just functionally serve as normal walls. After a few rooms of virtually no challenge you can get to the bottom of the tall fourth room and you'll need to continue right after breaking a smashable wall. After a couple more spike-filled rooms you encounter a mirror. When you pass by it, a Part of You will be moving in the opposite direction, and when Madeline stops to examine it, the mirror will break and Badeline will be released in her physical form. After this, all space blocks can now be used, and dashing through them gives access to much of the level unavailable before. By going back to the second room of the subchapter, a space block can be dashed up to get into the top transition and, after one more room, finish the subchapter.\n\nThe Crystal Heart of this chapter is found by going up from the very first room of the chapter. By using the fact that your dash refreshes when going through a screen transition, you can diagonally dash upward back and forth through the screens to get to the top. After ascending a few more rooms, the Crystal Heart will be there to be collected.\n\nThe Cassette room is found underneath the fourth room of the subchapter by dashing through the space block on the floor of this tall room after the mirror has been shattered.\n\n### **Strawberries**\\[\\]\n\nThere are 9 Strawberries found in this subchapter (not including the Golden Strawberry which spawns in the first room).\n\nBerry 1\n\nThis Strawberry is found in the same room as the mirror, but out of view without the use of [Skull Binoculars](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Objects#Skull_Binoculars). To reach it, you need to stay on the falling platform in the previous room and then go right into a hidden gap which allows you to grab the berry.\n\nBerry 2\n\nFound in the eighth room of the subchapter (to the top-left of the mirror room), this Strawberry can be found in a hidden area above the middle of the 3 space blocks, which you can dash upward through said space block to reach.\n\nBerry 3\n\nThis will be the first seeded Strawberry of the game. To collect these berries, you must not touch the floor before collecting all of the Strawberry Seeds. The room where it's found in is a tall room accessed from the upper 2 of 3 left transitions in the fourth room of the subchapter. Keep yourself airborne by dashing into any nearby space blocks as they move and you can get all the seeds.\n\nBerry 4\n\nFound in a room below the previous berry's room (past a smashable wall on the floor), or from the bottom left transition in the fourth room of the subchapter, this Strawberry will be simple if approached from the former route. It is possible to get the distance to grab this berry from below, but you should be smashing the floor in the room above to access it with no challenge.\n\nBerry 5\n\nFound in the fourth room of the subchapter, this Strawberry must be carefully approached. It is hovering in the upper area surrounded by many spikes and the collect it you must position yourself to diagonally dash downward into the area it's in, then either quickly dash straight upward or grab the wall, then dash straight upward to be in the safety to collect the Strawberry.\n\nBerry 6\n\nBy going to the transition right of where the previous berry is located, the 6th berry of the subchapter is seen. Dash upward diagonally to land yourself on the traffic light block and then dash directly right so you'll be stopped while the traffic light block is also stopped on the right. Dash from there to the Strawberry and climb up to safety.\n\nBerry 7\n\nTo the room right of the previous berry's room is where this Strawberry is found. The safest approach is to dash right after jumping into the space block, then dashing diagonally upward into the next and then grabbing the wall. After collecting the Strawberry, climb higher and then dash left twice through the space blocks to make it back.\n\nBerry 8\n\nHidden in the floor of berry 6's room is a transition. Line yourself up with the hole and dash straight down to get in. This will take you to a hidden tunnel above a previous room which contains this Strawberry.\n\nBerry 9\n\nThis Strawberry is found by backtracking to the second room of the subchapter and going straight up the space block to then go right and arrive above the third room of the subchapter. To collect the berry, dash directly right into the upper space block and then the lower one. Climb up to get the berry, then dash left twice and climb the wall as you return to claim the Strawberry.\n\n## **Gallery**\\[\\]\n\n| | _Chapters and Subchapters in Celeste_ |\n| --- |\n| Story

The subchapter will be mostly made up of [wind](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Objects#Wind) rooms, some of which have a unique trait of having wind which stops and starts blowing on a timer. There are no story moments found in this subchapter.\n\n## **Gameplay**\\[\\]\n\nThis subchapter may be short, but it can be quite tricky. In a few of the early rooms, the player is tasked with utilizing [green bubbles](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Objects#Green_Bubbles) to survive against the wind. The required strategy for these such rooms is to boost Madeline to near a floating platform using the green bubble and dash into it to climb up it and continue.\n\nIn the sixth room of the subchapter, the trick to complete the room is to activate the guided platform and then quickly run ahead and cause the falling platform to drop, allowing the guided platform to continue. There is also a key token later in the room which much be touched to move a key-activated platform out of the way and allow the guided platform to keep going and give the ability to complete the room. In the last two rooms of the subchapter, wind will be blowing on a timer before stopping, then starting up again shortly after. In the seventh room, by starting to move right as the wind starts blowing, it will always be possible to make it to the platform and climb it right as the wind stops blowing, and from there simply landing on the disappearing platforms below is all that's needed to finish. In the eighth and final room of the subchapter, play it slowly and wait for the wind to stop whenever attempting to go left at any point.\n\n### **Strawberries**\\[\\]\n\nThere are 7 Strawberries found in this subchapter.\n\nBerry 1\n\nAbove the left wall of the first room on the subchapter, a left transition will lead to a wind containing the first berry of the subchapter. Approach the Winged Strawberry from the left side by jumping all the way to the left and then jumping up the wall. You shouldn't be jumping while holding onto the wall, as this wastes your stamina and jumping normally will still get you height thanks to the wind. Use a wall cling jump to get above the crystal spikes and continue jumping up the higher part of the wall. When you get to the top, jump right and dash right (above where the Winged Strawberry is) to reach the starting ledge, which you then climb up to safety.\n\nBerry 2\n\nFound in the first room of the subchapter, this Strawberry is floating under the main platforming area of the room near the start. Walk off of the small platform above the berry and right as you touch it, start going left and dash diagonally up-left and grab the wall above the crystal spikes. Climb up the wall and land on it to claim the berry.\n\nBerry 3\n\nFound in the fourth room of the subchapter, this Strawberry is at the far-right side of the screen. To get this Strawberry, you need to first do the whole room normally and land on the bridge at the end. From there, wait until the triggered platform used earlier respawns, then go back down to the green bubble and direct it up-left and steer Madeline left to then grab onto the triggered platform. This will allow you to be on the platform while having a dash available. Ride it to the right side and jump to the berry to grab it, then jump back left and dash into the green bubble, allowing you to claim the Strawberry.\n\nBerry 4\n\nIn the fifth room of the subchapter, an alternate path to the left can be entered which leads to this berry's room. Using the harsh wind, jump left and dash left to barely be able to reach the Strawberry. Jump or climb up the left wall to reach the dash crystal, and from there jump right and diagonally dash up-right into the next dash crystal, then dash right again to enter the green bubble. Aim the green bubble directly right and then dash diagonally up-right into the last dash crystal, then fall down and dash directly right to make it back.\n\nBerry 5\n\nFound in the fifth room of the subchapter, this Strawberry is seen at the end in a complicated area. Ride the triggered platform to the right and collect the key token while holding onto the wall. Make a jump to the left and dash at the last moment to reach the key-activated platform, which you must climb to get back to safety and claim the berry.\n\nBerry 6\n\nFound in the eighth room of the subchapter, this Strawberry is found around the middle of the room floating around many crystal spikes. Take the closest green bubble directly left and allow the wind to blow you to the wall. Climb this wall and, when the wind stops, jump left to grab the berry and quickly dash directly right to get back to the wall. From here, climb back up and go to the green bubble and move on like normal.\n\nBerry 7\n\nA hidden room can be found to the right of the eighth room of the subchapter. To access it, go through the slightly cracked part of the right wall which is located right above the set of crystal spikes. The following room will have many green bubbles which you need to simply aim right and then dash up to advance. For the third green bubble, aim it down-right and dash up-right. Wall jump up the next corridor and take the green bubbles at the top to the left to finally see the Strawberry. Aim the final green bubble directly down to grab the berry, then dash to the side. Hold onto the wall and climb back up so you can wall jump into the green bubble and use it to get out of the room.\n\n##

Each Golden Berry requires the player to finish a chapter without dying in order to be collected. If the player dies, they will be sent back to the room with the Golden Strawberry. This room is usually the first in the chapter, with the exception of [Chapter 6: Reflection](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_6:_Reflection) A-Side, all sides of [Chapter 8: Core](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_8:_Core), and [Chapter 9: Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_9:_Farewell). In these levels, as well as the A and B-sides of [Chapter 7: The Summit](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_7:_The_Summit), starting from these Golden Strawberries will not give the player a clear time, although earning the Strawberry will set the player's lowest-death record to 0.\n\nGolden Strawberries tend to require a lot of practice. The main difference between regular play and attempting to obtain Golden Strawberries is that in regular play, many players will take a trial and error approach. This means that these players may clear harder rooms by luck or by methods that are easily forgettable.\n\nRelying on luck, however, can only take the player so far. This guide aims to provide strategies which help individual screens to be completed faster and, above all, more consistently. Some of these may use advanced movement. General knowledge of the game mechanics and being able to consistently pull off wavedashes and hyperdashes, among other tricks, certainly helps. If you are unfamiliar with advanced movement techniques, it is advised to check out the [Moves](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Moves) page.\n\nIt's good to know the route ahead of time, so a player does not unnecessarily risk going into rooms outside the main path; therefore, a practice run of the longer chapters can help prepare for the task at hand.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1Chapter 1: Forsaken City](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_1:_Forsaken_City)\n - [1.1A-Side (1A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(1A))\n - [1.2B-Side (1B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(1B))\n - [1.3C-Side (1C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(1C))\n- [2Chapter 2: Old Site](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_2:_Old_Site)\n - [2.1A-Side (2A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(2A))\n - [2.2B-Side (2B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(2B))\n - [2.3C-Side (2C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(2C))\n- [3Chapter 3: Celestial Resort](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_3:_Celestial_Resort)\n - [3.1A-Side (3A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(3A))\n - [3.2B-Side (3B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(3B))\n - [3.3C-Side (3C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(3C))\n- [4Chapter 4: Golden Ridge](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_4:_Golden_Ridge)\n - [4.1A-Side (4A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(4A))\n - [4.2B-Side (4B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(4B))\n - [4.3C-Side (4C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(4C))\n- [5Chapter 5: Mirror Temple](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_5:_Mirror_Temple)\n - [5.1A-Side (5A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(5A))\n - [5.2B-Side (5B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(5B))\n - [5.3C-Side (5C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(5C))\n- [6Chapter 6: Reflection](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_6:_Reflection)\n - [6.1A-Side (6A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(6A))\n - [6.2B-Side (6B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(6B))\n - [6.3C-Side (6C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(6C))\n- [7Chapter 7: The Summit](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_7:_The_Summit)\n - [7.1A-Side (7A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(7A))\n - [7.1.1Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Start)\n - [7.1.2500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#500_M)\n - [7.1.31000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#1000_M)\n - [7.1.41500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#1500_M)\n - [7.1.52000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#2000_M)\n - [7.1.62500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#2500_M)\n - [7.1.73000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#3000_M)\n - [7.2B-Side (7B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(7B))\n - [7.3C-Side (7C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(7C))\n- [8Chapter 8: Core](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_8:_Core)\n - [8.1A-Side (8A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(8A))\n - [8.2B-Side (8B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(8B))\n - [8.3C-Side (8C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(8C))\n- [9Chapter 9: Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_9:_Farewell)\n\n## [Chapter 1: Forsaken City](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_1:_Forsaken_City)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (1A)\\[\\]\n\n1A's very low difficulty makes it very easy to obtain the Golden Strawberry for the level as long as the player is not reckless, as the level is short and without many difficult sections.\n\nCompleting 1A without dashing will allow the player to collect the Winged Golden Strawberry. The Winged Golden Strawberry is unique because unlike other golden berries, the player does not have to worry about dying and it can be obtained before beating 8B.\n\n### B-Side (1B)\\[\\]\n\n1B is a much harder level than 1A. To obtain the Golden Berry, the player must have a decent understanding of how momentum works in this game, often requiring them to grab the traffic light blocks in a specific way to pass an obstacle. In addition, many rooms require the player to manage their stamina properly.\n\nIn the stamina management rooms, it is recommended to learn how to neutral jump, performed by tapping the jump button on a wall with no directional input, as this does not consume stamina. Knowing this trick will help reduce the risk of running out of stamina.\n\n### C-Side (1C)\\[\\]\n\n1C is usually considered the easiest or second easiest C-Side to beat with a Golden Strawberry, as the level's gameplay is relatively straightforward.\n\nIn the first room, dashing upwards into the crystals is the easiest and least risky way to get through the traffic light blocks.\n\nIn the second room, it is recommended to grab the first vertical traffic light block in the middle and the second one in the top or bottom. If the player is comfortable with advanced movement, they can wavedash or extended hyper to the first falling block, grab the second one, and do another wavedash on the final falling block, which allows the vertical traffic light blocks in the middle of the room to be skipped.\n\n## [Chapter 2: Old Site](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_2:_Old_Site)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (2A)\\[\\]\n\n2A is a slightly harder level than 1A, though one minor skip to note does exist and cuts off some of the challenges. The final vertical room of the Badeline chase sequence has multiple quicker strategies. The most notable skip in the final room is a noticeable platform at the beginning that hangs from a wall near some spikes, which leads to a narrow passage that must be dashed through to reach.\n\nMadeline standing at the location which the skip can be done\n\n### B-Side (2B)\\[\\]\n\n2B's Golden Strawberry is generally considered to be either easier or about as difficult as the one in 1B (especially easier if the player is comfortable with space block jumps).\n\nThe majority of difficult rooms involve Badeline chase segments, so it is recommended to find a safe strategy for these rooms. In addition, some rooms can be made easier with space block re-grabs (done by holding grab and the opposite direction in which the player initially dashed).\n\nIn the first room of the final subchapter, there's no need to jump off of the space block as the player can grab the side of it to make moving around easier. It will still be required later in this section though. Once the player goes to the cassette room, they can take their time as it is impossible to die.\n\n### C-Side (2C)\\[\\]\n\n2C's Golden Strawberry is generally tied with 1C's Golden Strawberry in terms of difficulty. The main challenge is mostly about learning the final room, as it is the only one that will likely be challenging for a player. In the last room, there are a few spots in which the player can grab the side of a space block to align themself for a dash. However, most of the space blocks near the end of the room will require space block jumps, so patience is not a possibility. The player should dash directly into the heart immediately after leaving the last space block so that they are not pushed into the spikes by the heart.\n\n## [Chapter 3: Celestial Resort](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_3:_Celestial_Resort)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (3A)\\[\\]\n\n3A's most difficult subchapters are the second, [Huge Mess](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Huge_Mess) and the fourth, [Presidential Suite](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Presidential_Suite).\n\nIn Huge Mess, try to find a room order that suits you the most (example: middle - bottom - top). The less clutter there is in a section, the harder is it to pass them. Try to start with the section you find the most troublesome, and then go with the easier ones. It may be easiest to do the section with the room you find hardest first.\n\nIn [Elevator Shaft](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Elevator_Shaft), the player may attempt to skip the subchapter's key by performing a demodash. However, this is a risky strategy. In the room with the key, the player will want to dash to the sinking platforms when the moving sludges move to the left.\n\nIn Presidential Suite, it's better to take it slow. Rushing and being impatient often results with the player dying in this level. In the part with a row of dash crystals over the dust bunnies, the best strategy is to wait until Oshiro is about to charge at you, and then jump over him and keep dashing. Doing this section like that gives you enough time to take it slow.\n\n### B-Side (3B)\\[\\]\n\nWhile it may look scary at first, 3B is surprisingly very well designed around the cycles. 3B's difficulty mainly derives from its first two subchapters. Many of 3B's screens can be completed in different ways, depending on your timing. It's recommended to keep that in mind to find alternative strategies for certain rooms. Learning how to neutral jump or bounce off of walls without grabbing them helps a lot with managing stamina in many rooms.\n\nApart from the room with key tokens, the [Start (Celestial Resort B-Side)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Celestial_Resort_B-Side)) is rather straightforward. The best way is to keep it slow and pay attention to the cycles. You can hang on the top corners of the bottom platforms without getting hit by the moving sludge. That way you can wait until the spring is close to you, allowing you to regain your dash and stamina.\n\nThe second subchapter may be the hardest one to learn. In the second room, prepare to jump off of the left walls when the moving sludges are about to move to the right. You can grab the top block as a safe spot. Do the same with the rest of the walls to proceed. The laundry room can be tricky to learn, but it gets very consistent if you get the muscle memory down. In the first laundry room (the one with blue walls), you can wall bounce off of the top right wall to grab the crystal and grab the overhang. It's a good safe spot to land on the purple platform below you. The third laundry section can also be started with a wall bounce to save some stamina. Moving sludges have a longer delay before they move, which is something you have to get used to when practicing.\n\nThe third room is mostly about muscle memory due to awkward timings in some spots. In the second room, you can keep jumping off of the left wall to time your dash between the moving sludges. If done properly, they will move in the middle of your jump, allowing you to dash between them and jumping off of the right wall. This strategy may be a bit risky at first, but it saves a lot of stamina. The second to last section of this subchapter looks very stressful, however it's actually really simple. Jump in between them when they move up, then perform a diagonal downwards dash when they're about to move down. If you understand the timing, this part becomes very simple. The last section can be done by just dashing from spring to spring. Depending on your timing, the cycles may be different, so try to find an alternative strategy just in case if the cycle won't be in your favor.\n\nIn the first Oshiro room, it's recommended to jump on him or climb up when he's about to charge, allowing you to regain your dash and stamina by bouncing off of his head, which can be very helpful at the end of the room. The fourth room can be tricky, however if you perform an extended super at the beginning, you will keep an extra dash while you'll still be collecting the dash crystals, giving you a secondary boost if Oshiro is about to attack you. This allows you to dodge him or the dust bunnies in a very consistent pattern. In the last room, don't waste your dashes, as using them in a wrong spot will most likely end up with dying to the sludge-spawning tiles. The cassette room is pretty straightforward, however try to take it slow to avoid dying on it. The wall on the bottom can be grabbed from different sides and the springs can help you grabbing many Shields at once.\n\n### C-Side (3C)\\[\\]\n\n3C is often considered one of the harder C-Sides for many players. However, most of this level is muscle memory. In the first section, the player needs to jump when the moving sludges are about to move, and then keep dashing diagonally upwards as soon as they grab the dash crystals. It often takes a while to get the rhythm, but once learned, it becomes consistent.\n\nThe third room requires at least one Oshiro bounce at the very end. Use the lightning effect as a visual cue to understand when it's best to jump. He attacks right after the animation ends, so try to jump when it's about to end and you should be able to land on his head easily. Once you get to the gate at the end, you can grab on its side and start moving up when Oshiro is about to charge. It should end with him landing right under Madeline, causing you to bounce off of him. This can be used to regain your dash in an easier way at the very end.\n\n## [Chapter 4: Golden Ridge](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_4:_Golden_Ridge)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (4A)\\[\\]\n\nA good portion of this chapter is just getting used to the wind physics. You can use tricks such as hyperdashes to speed it up, however try to use them only when you're feeling comfortable with it. Triggered platform and guided platform rooms are also worth practicing.\n\nThe snowball section may be tricky for players, as they can easily get hit if careless. Try to take it slow and dash only when you have enough time to move away from the obstacle. If you are close to the right side of the screen, try to wait until the snowball appears and then quickly dash to the right to avoid getting hit by it instantly.\n\n### B-Side (4B)\\[\\]\n\nThe B-Side requires the player to fight with the wind, while performing some tricky jumps, and memorizing patterns for several triggered platform and guided platform rooms that may be difficult. In guided platform rooms, keep in mind that the blocks don't have to fit perfectly into the gaps. If they're less than a block off, they should still fit into the tunnel. Because the rest is rather straightforward to learn, this one mostly relies on getting consistently good at these rooms.\n\nThe first difficult triggered platform room can be found in the middle of the second subchapter, [Stepping Stones](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Stepping_Stones). It's recommended to use as little stamina here as possible. After using the spring, try to jump on the platform so you grab the top of it, then try jumping on the other side without the need to climb back up. There's a significant bit of room for error in this one, but it's recommended to find a strategy without using much stamina. If you happen to start losing stamina while you're about to go to the end, you can quickly climb up and use the platform's momentum when jumping to get enough distance for the last dash crystal.\n\nThe second one can be found in the middle of [Gusty Canyon](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Gusty_Canyon), with three small triggered platforms moving to the right. Activate the first two so that they're very close in line, and then grab the last one as soon as possible and drop on the bottom one when there's enough space. Stay on it and wait until you get to the pillar of crystals. Jump, dash over the crystals and if done properly, you should be able to land on the middle triggered platform. Remember to crouch in order to not hit the ceiling made out of crystals.\n\nAfter that, a guided platform room can be reached, which is not too difficult as long as you remember to keep going quickly. As said before, the platform doesn't need to fit perfectly into the gaps, so try to not spend too much time aligning it and instead hop on the clouds as soon as possible and grab the triggered platform at the very top to get it out of the way. If you don't reach it in time and the guided platform disintegrates, you can also make it back down to the start with some simple maneuvering, which can be very helpful during a Golden Strawberry attempt.\n\nThe ending is a place where people may often die if they mess up the last jump. Wait until the blocks turn to pink, then slowly walk off the very edge of the platform as the blocks change to blue and dash right into the Crystal Heart.\n\n### C-Side (4C)\\[\\]\n\nThe main problem with this section is the second room. The player must be fast, and it's best to save your stamina when needed by not using the grab button while wall jumping. The last room is mostly straightforward but it's recommended to practice the cloud jumps. Try to dash a bit away from the cloud as the wind is pretty strong and you might miss it easily.\n\n## [Chapter 5: Mirror Temple](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_5:_Mirror_Temple)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (5A)\\[\\]\n\nThis chapter is fairly long in a casual run but there are several skips that can make it a lot quicker when doing a Golden Strawberry run. The first one can be found in one of the rooms in the [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Mirror_Temple)) subchapter. When the player stays on the right side of the swap block while it's at the very bottom, they can perform a reversed hyperdash followed by a regular straight dash to skip straight past the corridor of crystals and reach the key room which saves a little bit of time. If you're not comfortable with this technique, it is certainly not a necessity to learn as the time save is not too major.\n\nThe next skip can be found close to the end of the second subchapter, [Depths](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Depths). The player can use the key door skip that's normally required to get the Crystal Heart. Because of that, there's no need to look out for the key which saves some time.\n\nThe last skip, called Search Skip, can be found at the beginning of [Search](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Search). When the player gets to the platforms with keys under them, they can skip most of this subchapter with a specific technique. In order to do it, stay on the left side of the platform to the left and perform a reverse super extended diagonally upwards. It's recommended to practice the timing in order to be capable of performing this trick with replenishing your dash as well. If you don't regain your dash, it means you're doing it too early.\n\nThe rest of the level is pretty much the same, but it's recommended to play through [Rescue](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Rescue) a few times to avoid getting killed by Seekers. If you throw the crystal against a wall and dash upwards into it, you can reach some higher ground if timed properly. If you dash horizontally into the crystal, you gain more momentum for a short amount of time, allowing yourself to escape situations such as being chased by a Seeker. Try to not rely 100% on one strategy and always have a plan B just in case, as Seekers may be a bit unpredictable at times. If you go to a certain spot slightly too quick or too slow, they may move in a completely different place. Keep that in mind to avoid surprise deaths.\n\n### B-Side (5B)\\[\\]\n\nIn the second subchapter, the player can save time by only grabbing one of the keys (the right one is easier but slower, the left one is more difficult but quicker), which allows the player to save time by performing a spike jump (avoiding the key needed for the intended strategy). Although this saves a fair amount of time, it is risky and should be avoided for less experienced players.\n\nIn the final room of the third subchapter, [Through the Mirror](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Through_the_Mirror), a reliable route is to immediately do three supers in a row from the right-hand edge of the initial platform, followed by a brief hesitation before an ordinary jump into the gap. The Seeker will reliably stop within reach. Alternatively, the player can avoid the Seeker entirely by performing an ultra with the final two platforms on the left side, giving enough distance to make it to the rightmost platform. An extended hyperdash from the last platform on the lower right, followed by a dash to grab the side of the platform, also clears the gap. Refer to the subchapter's main page for more specific details on timings.\n\n### C-Side (5C)\\[\\]\n\n5C's Golden Strawberry requires the use of many wall bounces, so it may be in the player's best interest to become comfortable with the mechanic. There's not much to this level except just learning how to time specific dashes or bounces.\n\nIn the first room, the player may opt to perform a wavedash (or extended hyper) on the starting platform to skip the first wall bounce of the room.\n\nIn the second room, a consistent strategy is for the player to align themselves with the center of the swap block's path, which will prevent them from missing the correct timing for the wall bounce.\n\nAt the beginning of the third room, you can use the bottom route to get to the bubbles without much trouble.\n\n## [Chapter 6: Reflection](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_6:_Reflection)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (6A)\\[\\]\n\n6A's Golden Strawberry is located in the second subchapter, [Lake](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Lake). This means that the player can skip the first subchapter, [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Reflection)), and go straight to the second subchapter using the menu.\n\nThe beginning of Chapter 6 is rather straightforward and doesn't require much practice because the player has a lot of room for error to deal with. In the beginning of [Hollows](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Hollows), there's an alternate way to get to the top by doing neutral jumps off of the left wall and then jumping and dashing to the right when at the top of the wall. It's not necessarily faster nor practical, but if a player is comfortable with neutral jumping and afraid of getting crushed by the angry platform, they can use this alternative way.\n\nThe main difficulty of this chapter is the boss fight. Some of the first rooms can be done easily by trying to hit Badeline as soon as possible. In some of the later screens, it's better to take it slow as she can easily catch you off guard. In the feather rooms, try to wait until she shoots the laser and jump and start flying right away. That way you will have enough time to run away from the attack, and if needed, you can dash away from the feather to a safe spot to avoid getting hit. In the long vertical rooms, you can hit Badeline several times by dashing into her from mid-air. It's recommended to hit her as soon as possible in these sections.\n\nThe second phase is generally easier due to it being shorter and giving the player enough time to react. In two sections you have to use a block to momentum jump into her. To perform that, start moving and jump when the block is about to stop, to gain maximum distance. The final room can be easy to mess up, so be sure to learn the timings in it. Similar to the previous rooms, jump into the feather as soon as the laser is gone and fly towards the next safe spot. When you get to the split paths, take the bottom route. It's less risky and it gives you enough time to move away from the beam with this strategy. After that, take your time to perform the next few jumps and pay attention to the laser. Once you get to the cutscene, the berry will be yours.\n\nAs a general tip, don't rush in the laser sections if you aren't confident enough. The indicator moves for a few seconds and then stops for a second, allowing you to jump or grab a block out of its way. Use this to dodge the attacks.\n\n### B-Side (6B)\\[\\]\n\nThough mostly considered fun to complete conventionally, most players quickly realize that this level can be rather frustrating to get the golden strawberry for. It is very difficult to be consistent with quick and precise movements from the feathers, many bumpers which call for specific angling, and a Badeline AI that can change with any slight variations in the player's strategy. It is important to just get a feel for it through practice to minimize the inconsistencies.\n\nIn the sixth room of the [\\|Reflection](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Reflection_(B-Side)) subchapter, the need for the angry platform can be removed entirely with an extended hyperdash, saving the dash that needed to be regained using the aforementioned block. However, this does not save much time.\n\nThe ninth room of the same subchapter requires a lot of precision near the end, it is one of the levels where the strategy is clear but it just requires a lot of practice, though it is important to pay attention to those last two holes. If to the left of the second to last hole, just do a dash; if to the right, then positioning must be corrected towards the left after the dash. That difference makes the last segment feel very inconsistent.\n\nThe second room of the [Rock Bottom](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Rock_Bottom_(B-Side)) subchapter can be made easier by remembering to dash upwards to reach the first falling block and right to reach the second, grabbing onto the left side and jumping over the top at the appropriate time is easier than trying to avoid them entirely.\n\nIn the third room of the subchapter, after the first time Badeline has been touched, the following laser can be dodged by jumping off the falling platform early so she aims it high giving enough time to clear the gauntlet and touch her again before the next laser.\n\nIn the fourth room, it can be tricky near the end of the second use of the second feather, though cutting as much corners in the path as possible can buy time to navigate over the crystals, to the switch and to the third Badeline touch.\n\nIn the fifth room, extended hyperdashing off of the disappearing platform at the end can saving having to use the final bumper which can be tricky with Badeline firing away.\n\nIn the second room of [Reprieve](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Reprieve), after touching Badeline for a second time, the moving wall can be ignored by bouncing on top of the bumper, then dashing into the bumper from the right and dashing up-right over it to Badeline.\n\nIn the fourth room of this subchapter, it is useful to try and bait out Badeline's laser at a safe space before running through each gauntlet whenever possible when entering the room or when grabbing on the side of a wall.\n\nThe last room before the rhythm block room that contains the heart is very hard to complete consistently, fortunately it is the room with the least need for consistency as the relatively easy rhythm block room is the only challenge that lies after it. Retry this room many times until you get comfortable with all of the timing necessary, but remember that the timings on respawns will not be the same as the ones on first entrance which will be what you must follow in your actual Golden Strawberry attempt.\n\n### C-Side (6C)\\[\\]\n\nThe C-Side is rather straightforward, however it's recommended to practice the ending and try to beat it a few times. Some of the bumpers are easy to miss, especially the very last one that can easily lead to a devastating death next to the heart. In some situations it's more safe to dash into a bumper, as hitting it will replenish your dash anyway, and that way you will be more sure that you will not miss it.\n\n## [Chapter 7: The Summit](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_7:_The_Summit)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (7A)\\[\\]\n\nThis is the longest level in the game aside from [Chapter 9: Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_9:_Farewell), meaning that deaths will be very costly especially later on. Knowledge on all of the subchapters will be crucial to ensure that the least time possible is wasted.\n\n#### [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(The_Summit))\\[\\]\n\nThis has rather straightforward platforming and is the easiest part of the level. In the room with a few vertical thin walls, you can skip some of them by dashing under them, making this section a little faster. Apart from that there isn't much difference than the casual run.\n\n#### [500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/500_M)\\[\\]\n\nThis one is also pretty straightforward. As long as you're comfortable with momentum, it shouldn't be too bad. In the section with key tokens, you can grab on the walls and feel free to use springs to replenish your dashes.\n\n#### [1000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/1000_M)\\[\\]\n\nOne of the easiest sections if the player is taking it slowly. If you are rushing it too much, you may risk wasting your dash by accident, not getting enough distance to dash through a space block. Although it's not needed in the game, jumping out of them may make certain actions easier and it can save up a dash for later. In the section with key tokens, a good order is: left, bottom, top, right. After getting the last one to the right, you can use the spring to get your dashes back.\n\n#### [1500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/1500_M)\\[\\]\n\nThis is generally considered to be the second hardest subchapter. Due to the cycles, this one requires some patience to avoid falling into a dust bunny or other obstacle.\n\nIn the section with the four moving sludges and one key token in the middle, use the bottom moving sludge as a visual cue. Stay on the line between the bottom blocks, wait until the moving sludge at the bottom goes to the up-left and then goes back to the bottom-right. Be prepared so right after it goes to the bottom-right, do a diagonal dash to the key token and after a somewhat short delay, perform another diagonal dash. It may be tricky to do at first, but with enough practice it becomes very simple.\n\nThe next section with key tokens is more open. However, if you're careless, you might dash right into a moving sludge. A good strategy is to do a well-spaced diagonal dash followed by a straight dash to the right. If by any means the moving sludge gets in your way, you can dash diagonally, wait for a split second and perform another diagonal dash to the right.\n\nThe last tricky section is at the end. There's some leeway with blocks on which you can stand on if you get a bad pattern or don't want to risk dying. Keep in mind that you can stand on them only once, so either don't walk on the entire platform or dash above/below the moving sludge from the air when going from one direction.\n\n#### [2000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2000_M)\\[\\]\n\nThis is another straightforward checkpoint, however there are two spots that may kill a player. In the first room with wind, there's a spring on the wall that bounces you towards a small floating platform with a spike on top. You have to dash once after getting bounced by the spring and then let yourself get pushed to the left by the wind, however don't do it immediately or you might fly right into the spike. The second tricky section has snowballs that can kill you if you\u2019re careless. Don't mess around too much with tricks and take your time. After it the rest should be rather simple to do.\n\n#### [2500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2500_M)\\[\\]\n\nThis is one of the easiest checkpoints if the player knows how swap blocks and their momentum work. Keep in mind that momentum can be cruel and if you are dashing from a swap block, always jump off of it or you might risk getting pushed off of your destination due to momentum. In the section with the key, you can slide on the left wall and wait until the obstacles move away. It's recommended to keep a dash for the last row of moving blades, as it will save you some struggle.\n\n#### [3000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/3000_M)\\[\\]\n\nThe hardest part of the entire level lies towards the end. Most of it is rather easy to understand and straightforward, however it's recommended to do a few deathless runs of this checkpoints to gain consistency. Pay extra attention to difficult checkpoints such as 16, 14, 13, 11, 10, 9, and 3. They have some timings that are fairly tight for an A-Side and they may easily kill your run if you\u2019re careless. Pay attention to the wind as it also affects your jumps. If the wind blows down, you jump slightly lower, fall faster, and can\u2019t climb as high. If it's blowing up, Madeline is more floaty and jumps slightly higher.\n\n### B-Side (7B)\\[\\]\n\n7B is an extremely long chapter and is considered to be one of the most challenging Golden Strawberries as a result. However, most strategies are straightforward and much of the chapter's difficulty lies in precision. Unfortunately, there is not much to be said other than just practice to help with parts like 3000 M's dreaded checkpoint 13 or while timing bubble exits at 2500 M. Due to its sheer length it is heavily advised to do a lot of practice before ever picking up the golden strawberry, even then it is good to take breaks and go to individual rooms that have caused significant trouble.\n\nThe third room of the 500 M segment is one of the easiest rooms in the game when done correctly, extended hyperdashing off of the first platform will allow the player to just simply dash under then up the block with the first spring on it. Bear in mind the last three blocks with the spikes on top do not need to be grabbed as they too can just be dashed under then up.\n\nIn the third room of 1500 M the cycle can be navigated by leaving as the first moving sludge starts to move from its low position to its high position, from there immediately go to the bottom left switch and onto the spring board right next to it which should launch Madeline to meet the moving platform with a spring in the middle of its path, from there dash up onto the wall to the right of the circling sludge and jump for the top right switch when that moving sludge is just past its closest point to said switch. Go for the spring at the bottom left again which should send Madeline towards the bottom switch, follow that with two dashes upwards in order to land on the spring and head to the bottom right switch. Grab onto the wall and wait to bounce on the spring when it is moving towards Madeline AND the moving sludge is moving away. From there, dash upwards and grab onto the wall next to the final switch, waiting for the nearby moving sludge to move to its low point to jump for the switch and to the end.\n\nThe final room of 1500 M seems very difficult to do consistently. One strategy is to dash into the lower spring as the nearby moving sludge starts moving downwards, dash past the first two moving moving sludges at a steady pace, wait for the third moving sludge to move towards its high position before dashing past and dash past the fourth as it is sitting at its low position. Dash past the fifth moving sludge before it moves downwards in order to hit the spring and pass over it as it is moving down. At the last moving sludge, dash upwards before reaching it and follow with an up-left dash, grabbing onto the wall above the last spring, from there just wait until any appropriate time to drop onto the spring to avoid the moving sludge and dash up towards the end of the segment.\n\nFor the third room of [2000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2000_M_(B-Side)) it is important to note that Madeline can go up to the respawn point without the snowballs appearing. From that point, hyperdash and follow that with a right dash into the left side of the first pillar, climb up it and the first snowball should go under Madeline. Once the pillar has been climbed repeat the process, hyperdash off, dashing into the side and climbing up.\n\nThe strategy for the last room at [2500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2500_M_(B-Side)) is straightforward, however it can be easier to time the exit of the first red bubble by looking at the squid-like eldritch statue in the background and dashing out as the bubble covers its eye.\n\nCheckpoint 17 of [3000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/3000_M_(B-Side)) can be skipped by jumping to the left followed by a up-left dash and an upwards dash in order to super wall jump off of the wall, this will send Madeline high enough and far enough left to be able to grab onto the edge at the base of checkpoint 16.\n\nCheckpoint 4 can be made easier by wavedashing off the edge followed by two upwards dashes. Same can be said for the checkpoint 3, wavedashing left and dashing straight up can skip a dangerous wall bounce. This technique also helps skip to the first cloud of checkpoint 2.\n\n### C-Side (7C)\\[\\]\n\nThe first section of the level is more forgiving that it looks. If you memorize how it looks and if you mess up a wall bounce, you can fall down and grab one of the ledges at the bottom and wait for the dash crystal to reappear. That way you can save yourself from death.\n\nThe last room is muscle memory. The beginning is the hardest part as it requires precise timings. Some springs require to be hit as high as possible to pass through tall walls of crystals. After playing through the room a couple of times and having it fresh in your memory, it should naturally be simpler to complete the room in a Golden Strawberry attempt.\n\n## [Chapter 8: Core](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_8:_Core)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (8A)\\[\\]\n\n8A's Golden Strawberry is located in the second subchapter, [Into the Core](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Into_the_Core). This means that the player can skip the first subchapter, [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Core)), and go straight to the second subchapter using the menu.\n\nA good portion of this chapter is memorizing how patterns work. Close to the beginning, there's a major skip known as Ice Skip. In order to perform it, go to the berry room to the left, come back to the room with fire balls on top and keep running, jump into the crystal, dash upwards and then do two diagonal dashes to the top. Keep in mind that the dashes need to be spaced out a bit in order to fit between the flames. Once learned, the strategy becomes very consistent.\n\nAnother room the player may struggle with is the room in [Hot and Cold](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_and_Cold) which has columns of ice balls and bumpers around. Try to find a pattern there and don't rush it. Keep it slow and remember that you can bounce around from one row to another. There's a fair amount of dash crystals that will replenish your dash when needed. At the end of the section, it's best to jump from one row to another and flip the hot/cold switch to progress.\n\nThe last section is not particularly difficult, but it's best to memorize how everything works in them. Because of time pressure, a player may do a lot of mistakes. Despite the time limit, the player still has a decent amount of time to plan their jumps or other actions. In the cassette room, it's best to jump slowly from platform to platform. Keep your dashes for the fire parts and if you don't rush too much, you should be able to complete it fairly easily.\n\n### B-Side (8B)\\[\\]\n\n8B's Golden Strawberry is located in the second subchapter, [Into the Core](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Into_the_Core_(B-Side)). This means that the player can skip the first subchapter, [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Core_B-Side)), and go straight to the second subchapter using the menu.\n\n8B's Golden Strawberry is regarded as the second- or third-most difficult golden in the game. It is very important to develop consistent strategies. Rooms with no or little cycles often show clear strategies and are often down to just skill. This chapter contains many cycles which can be more consistently bypassed with some of the techniques stated below.\n\nThe first room is very chaotic and initially looks daunting to learn. The following pattern will allow all fireballs to be dodged with proper fine tuning of jump height. Wait at the edge and do a short jump as soon as a fireball goes just high enough to jump under, this is to be shortly followed by a up-right dash, jumping immediately as Madeline lands on the next platform and dashing upwards when below the dash crystal, stay still and fall a dash's distance and follow that with a very quick up-right then right dash on to the next platform, follow that with a quick jump off to the right, collecting the dash crystal, dashing up right twice and quickly jumping over the last two platforms.\n\nThe fourth room can be very easily cleared with the correct timing, if the player starts moving as soon as they enter the room (alternatively they can jump off the solid ground the moment they see an ice ball rise from the spikes at the first column), after jumping off the solid ground and dashing up-right they can just jump across the ice balls, just holding left for the first crystal wall, halting at the second and fourth crystal walls in order to fall around half a dash's distance to keep holding right again and halting at the 3rd crystal wall to dash though it.\n\nThe room that marks the start of the [Burning or Freezing](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_or_Freezing) subchapter can be the most difficult to learn due to challenges in grip management. It is advised to touch the launching block when the first fireball touches the bottom wall of crystals (the full cycle involves a full rotation of either of the first two fireballs). Using correct timing to navigate the first two fireballs will allow the final fireball to be accessed by waiting slightly before shooting up the conveyor wall and wall jumping off the protrusion below the fireballs path to the right then off of the left wall.\n\nThe third room of the subchapter can be fairly difficult to learn, though it can be cleared as quickly if the player immediately starts going through it right after entering at walking pace, take as few jumps as possible in order to avoid running out of ice balls to jump on.\n\nThe fifth room of this subchapter has a fairly simple solution to learn, jump onto the first conveyor as a fire ball brushes on top of it, drop just left of the middle of the second ring of fire balls and right dash out of it onto the next conveyor wall and simply jump from the top of it to the next with no delay after jumping off the third conveyor wall up-right dash in the middle of the fifth ring of fire balls to collect the dash crystal, heading right until level with the bottom of the final double-sided conveyor wall, after a very short wait shoot up the conveyor wall onto the other side and then immediately shoot up the right side, making the jump with the last dash.\n\nThe last room of the subchapter is rather difficult. Jump off when a fire ball of the first ring is pointing left and quickly double up-right dash and drop to the first dash crystal, repeat that to get the second dash crystal and then immediately up-right then right dash and drop in to get the third, from there up-right then upwards dash to hit the switch, bounce off of the two ice balls to the left and right of the first ice ring followed by all three from the current left to right of the next. On the next ice ring, jump off of the left ice ball and into the switch followed immediately by and upwards then up-right dash to drop into the next dash crystal with an up-right then right dash, dropping into the second last ring of fire balls, upon hitting the switch there should be an ice ball right under Madeline to bounce off and from there the player can make their way to the end by jumping off the ice balls.\n\nIf you are comfortable with neutral jumping, skipping the fire switch can make the first two rooms of [Heartbeat](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Heartbeat) easier. Ignore the switch and start climbing on the left wall, getting to the frozen platforms. Quickly jump off of them and dash towards the crystal, and after that you should be able to dash to the end of the room. The second room is also more straightforward as there's no need to use the switch on the left side, allowing the player to climb the right wall and start bouncing off of the ice balls.\n\nThe second room of the sub-chapter is mostly straight forward, though one thing of note is that it can be easier to reliably get inside the first ring of fire/ice balls by climbing and jumping off of the right wall.\n\nThe third room of the sub-chapter can seem impossible to learn at first due to its second half, though there is a strategy that one can use to make it easier. wait at the top of the last conveyor wall until a fire ball of the first ring of fire balls points down-right, follow this with two up-right dashes to the dash crystal followed by nothing but upwards dashes, though some minor delays and horizontal adjustments should be made after some of the upwards dashes.\n\nThe last room before the cassette block room can be difficult for people who aren't familiar with launching block momentum. It has a specific pattern that needs to be followed: stay slightly to the right from the middle of the first launching block, then grab the very top of the second block and at the end stay low on the second one, allowing you to use both dashes to get to the edge of the platform. If you miss the timing on the middle block, you can save yourself by either climbing or neutral jumping (the latter is safer though) to the top. It's recommended to practice this room a lot as launching block momentum can be pretty unforgiving.\n\n### C-Side (8C)\\[\\]\n\nThis C-Side is mostly a matter of getting used to the third section. Try to get used to the momentum-based platforms and whenever you have time to wait, use it to max out the time that you will have to go through a part of the section. Hitting switches too early can sometimes end up with certain sections being very hard or impossible to clear. When dashing through the space blocks, if you do a horizontal dash through the second one followed by a space block jump, you can clear the third space block while keeping your dash, which can help make the next bumpers section much more consistent.\n\n## [Chapter 9: Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_9:_Farewell)\\[\\]\n\nFarewell's Golden Strawberry is located in the second subchapter, [Singular](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Singular). This means that the player can skip the first subchapter [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Farewell)) and go straight to the second subchapter using the menu.\n\nThe golden strawberry in Farewell is by far the most difficult one to obtain. Not only are there many extremely difficult rooms that can impede a player's progress, the chapter is also significantly longer than every other chapter in the game. Due to its absurd difficulty, Reddit user DJTom3 is attempting to keep track of everyone who has collected the Farewell Golden Strawberry with verified video proof. As of November 27, 2020, [the list](https://www.reddit.com/user/DJTom3/comments/k1hic9/celeste_farewell_golden_strawberry_collectors_list/) currently has 121 verified entries. [The Farewell Golden Collectors' List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FesTb6qkgMz-dCn7YdioRydToWSQNTg1axFEIHU4FF8/edit?gid=571489394#gid=571489394) is sill being updated every few weeks and count 837 players (15 December 2024).\n\nFarewell has a variety of skips that can be used to make the level take less time, however some of them aren't very viable due to the high risk required to pass them.\n\nOne of the major skips is the [Power Source](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Source) skip. In order to do it, the player needs to have a double dash, a jellyfish and they have to destroy the utility vault. Once it's done, they need to grab the jellyfish with the double dash and go into the hidden top room with the red bubble that leads to a key. The player can skip it by throwing a jellyfish into the tunnel, quickly entering the bubble and updashing into the jellyfish in the right moment to gain enough height to get to the next room. After that they have to perform a rather precise diagonal dash which leads to a hidden room which has fairly simple jumps. This skip can be difficult for some people, but once mastered, it may cut a lot of time for a golden run, especially considering it's fairly early in the level.\n\nIn [Remembered](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Remembered), it is possible to take a jellyfish to the room with tall falling blocks. It can be used to your advantage by updashing and collecting the refills to gain enough height.\n\nIt should be noted that the player sometimes has the option to do extended hyperdashes instead of wavedashes, a tougher technique although it can make some sections easier as they won't be as pressured to jump quickly from one platform to another. This may be especially useful for sections such as the \"comb room\", one of the rooms near the end of [Event Horizon](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Event_Horizon) with triggered platforms. Using an extended hyperdash here usually makes it easier for the player to align themselves to the wall bounce. Generally, watch for the triggered platform to pass the second pillar of crystals to do the wavedash/hyperdash, then for the second triggered platform, watch for it to just reach the first of the pillars of crystals to the right.\n\nIn the tutorial room with two wavedashes followed by a wall bounce, players can stay on the middle block and perform an extended hyperdash instead of a wavedash. If done right, they will grab the very right side of the wall, allowing them to jump to the left and use a wall bounce to get to the top of the platform. This strategy is less risky, because the player doesn't have to deal with momentum from speed tech.\n\nThe tenth room of Event Horizon can sort of skipped by grabbing the very bottom of the triggered platform, allowing you to pass under the crystals above and make the remainder of the room much easier. This strategy allows you to skip the key token in this room.\n\n[Determination](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Determination) is often considered the hardest checkpoint due to a rather tricky rooms the player has to pass through. The first problematic room is the third room, containing a triggered platform with springs on both sides. Make sure to wait for a second when activating the platform, then jumping back right and quickly dashing up towards the crystal and keeping up with the platform. In the area with the double dash crystals, try to slow yourself down and not dash too immediately if needed to not be faster than the triggered platform.\n\nIn the first room with starblades, do a wavedash to the right when the starblades are at the bottom to ensure you can dodge them. In the large vertical room where you must fall past many starblades, do your wavedash or extended hyperdash when they are at the right side and don't be too averse to holding down to accelerate your descent if it would be safer.\n\nThe next hard room is the wind room with springs. With enough practice, it should be rather consistent, however this room needs to be taken very seriously as it's a common choke point. The following room with conveyors can be saved by neutral jumping off of the icy wall in case if you mess up or want to align yourself properly. The last room of Determination is mostly just memorizing how the starblades move, so they don't get in your way when the wind changes. Remember to not play around too much at the end, as being too slow often can result in Madeline being thrown into the starblades at the end of this section. Memorize how the starblades move on the first cycle of the room (aka the one when entering the room as opposed to after a respawn) as this will be what will most consistently occur in a Golden Strawberry run and is thus the most important muscle memory to gather.\n\nThe fourth room of [Stubbornness](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Stubbornness) has some rather tricky timing towards the end. Instead of trying to grab the pink wall, try to dash towards the blue block at the right timing, then jump back to the pink block and again jump towards the blue block to the very right. You have to time it properly so the previous blue block doesn't appear right in front of you.\n\n[Reconciliation](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Reconciliation) is pretty straightforward for most of the time and there aren't many strategies to go speedily that a person can do. However, as this is very near the end of the chapter, it should be taken carefully and slowly whenever possible. In some of the last rooms, there are parts with moving blocks that have different strategies, so try to develop a consistent pattern that suits yourself. In the feather section with a lot of pufferfish scattered around, players can technically skip the feather by either using the fish or wavedashing off of the block at the bottom. [Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Farewell) is pretty much the same as in casual runs and it's recommended to take it slowly as being too hasty may end up with doing mistakes far in the level.\n\nFarewell, unlike other chapters, has a secret room that can only be accessed when the player carries a Golden Berry. It's quite straightforward and it has very few difficult parts, but the player has no opportunity to practice it (unless they're using Debug Mode). There are binoculars that allow the player to check the layout of it, so be sure to look around to see what dangers are around and plan your strategies carefully. You have to be very careful, as failing in this room will take you to the very beginning of the level. If you don't care much about the surprise factor and you want to practice the room, you can use Debug Mode to teleport yourself to the room and mess around with it.\n\nDue to the fact Farewell is very long, it's recommended to do individual runs of each checkpoint to be sure if you're able to complete it without dying. First, try to complete one of each checkpoint without dying, and then try to do two or more of them with as much fails as possible. Consistency is very important for this chapter, and it requires an insane amount of practice and good muscle memory to deal with the length of difficulty of this chapter. Watching someone go for the Golden Strawberry on this level in videos such as [this](https://youtu.be/niuCpSOX_jI) is recommended, as you then see the skips they make, and hopefully, that will help you.\n\nCommunity content is available under [CC-BY-SA](https://www.fandom.com/licensing) unless otherwise noted.\n\nAdvertisement"

Dash into the small cove to the left of the waterfall and walk through the wall to find the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/2/24/180129_CI_C4_S1.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nadvertisement\n\n### Strawberry \\#2\n\nOn the screen after talking with the old lady, you can spot the strawberry near the bottom. Use the wind to press you against the wall with the strawberry. Climb up and dash to the column in the middle. Hop to the other side and then jump to the ledge for safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/e/ee/180129_CI_C4_S2.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#3\n\nUsing the bubbles to break through the walls, you can spot the strawberry near the top between columns of spikes. Use the bubble beneath to dash up and grab the fruit. The bubble will return for you to continue dashing through the walls.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/d/de/180129_CI_C4_S3.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#4\n\nOn the screen that intorduces the disappearing pink clouds you will see htis strawberry on the right side. Use the final cloud\u2019s lift and a dash the nab it and then climb up to safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/7/7a/180129_CI_C4_S4.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#5\n\nSimilar to Strawberry #2, you\u2019ll want to use the wind to collect this strawberry. Drop down to the wall adjacent to the strawberry. Use your dash to fight the rightward wind to get the strawberry. Use that wind to safely jump back to the other wall. Climb out and drop to the ground to secure the fruit.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/46/180129_CI_C4_S5.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#6\n\nAfter activating the switches to open the path, smash the suspicious looking block in the left corner to find this strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/8/81/180129_CI_C4_S6.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#7\n\nOn the screen that has three clouds over a large hole with a leftward wind, use the second cloud to jump up and to the left. Dash to make it to the left corner where a secret path can be found.\n\nThere are four strawberry seeds on the screen. You must collect them all without your feet touching the ground to create a strawberry. Whenever you grab one seed, a leftward wind will immediately start blowing. You need to use this wind to navigate the room without touching the floor.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/2/22/180129_CI_C4_S7_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nStarting on the right, climb the wall to grab the first seed. Use the wind to leap to the first column and then hop over to the spring on the other side. This spring recharges your stamina and dash. Fighting the wind, jump straight up and dash to grab the wall next to the second seed. Jump off and back down to the spring to recharge with two seeds in tow.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/5/55/180129_CI_C4_S7_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nGrab onto the second column and hop over to its left side. Slide down and drop to the third seed, dashing up and to the left once you grab it. The wind will carry you to the third column. Your stamina will start to run low.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/4d/180129_CI_C4_S7_C.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nHop of the third column and then to the left wall. Now wall jump up to the final seed to create the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/d/d4/180129_CI_C4_S7_D.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nadvertisement\n\n### Cassette Tape\n\nOn the screen that has three clouds over a large hole with a leftward wind, use the second cloud to jump up and to the left. Dash to make it to the left corner where a secret path can be found. Walk to the left on the screen with the seeds.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/1/1c/180129_CI_C4_CT.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThis is the cassette room. The blue and pink platforms alternate based off the beat of the music. Time your jumps to navigate the room on the alternating platforms to grab the tape. This unlocks Chapter 4\u2019s B Side level.\n\n### Strawberry \\#8\n\nUse the rightward wind to wall jump up the right-hand wall without using stamina. When the wind stops jump to the column near the strawberry, using your dash. Hop over the top and grab the strawberry. The wind will kick back up and blow you back to the right side where it is safe to land.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/0/0c/180129_CI_C4_S8.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n## Shrine\n\nThis area of the chapter features one off rooms that contain plenty of secrets and strawberries. Once you complete a room, it closes off to you from further access.\n\n### Strawberry \\#9 & 10\n\nAt the start of the shrine area, head into the open path to the right. You\u2019ll find a moving block that you\u2019ll have to navigate through gaps to reach the strawberries on the right. That\u2019s correct\u2014two strawberries!\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/a/a5/180131_CI_C4_S9.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThe first is out in the open. Ride the block making sure it goes beneath the spike platforms. After jumping the second spike platform, press the block down so it can reach the far right wall. Jump and dash to grab Strawberry #9. Land on the platform again to regain your dash and grab the far right wall.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/a/a8/180131_CI_C4_S10.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nDash through the block above to find Strawberry #10. Jump onto the left facing block and ride it back to secure both strawberries.\n\n### Strawberry \\#11\n\nBack in the main area of the shrine, climb and dash up the left wall and enter the hallway. You can see the strawberry beneath the bridge. You\u2019ll need to ride the moving block below to be able to grab the fruit.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/3/3c/180131_CI_C4_S11.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nRide on the right-hand side of the block. Jump up to snag the strawberry and then dash back to the block to ride it to the other side.\n\n### Strawberry \\#12\n\nReturn to the main area of the shrine and use the moving block to go straight up. Inside this area you will find this strawberry. Use the moving blocks to cross the room and nab the fruit. Use the left facing block in the upper right corner to return back to the beginning.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/2/22/180131_CI_C4_S12.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#13\n\nContinuing upward through the main shrine area, enter the second entrance on the left side. This strawberry requires navigating a few rooms to get to it. Using the moving block to go left, thread it through the small gap in the platforms. Hop over the obstacles and land back on your moving block, pushing it down so you may reach the other side. Jump up and dash to the platform above.\n\nadvertisement\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/2/26/180131_CI_C4_S13_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nIn the next room you must use the upward moving block to reach bubbles at the top of the screen. Use the bubbles to make it to the top left corner and then navigate your way down the left side of the screen.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/3/32/180131_CI_C4_S13_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nOn the final screen, use the bubble to move diagonally toward the moving block. Use your dash to grab on and move it to the right. When it brteaks on the ceiling, drop down and to the right to land next to the strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#14\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/c/c7/180131_CI_C4_S14_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nHead to the area at the top of the shrine area screen. You\u2019ll end up next to an outhouse. Use the pink cloud to hop onto the top of the moving block. Weave it up and down to reach the oppostie wall. Drop down to the next screen and walk over to get the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/3/3b/180131_CI_C4_S14_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#15\n\nGrab onto the moving block in the main area of the shrine and weave it to the left around the main obstacle. Go back to the right to reach the glowing area.\n\nHop into the water and swim to the right to find a hidden area with a strawberry. Smash the right wall to find more secrets!\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/6/6d/180131_CI_C4_S15.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#16\n\nGrab onto the moving block in the main area of the shrine and weave it to the left around the main obstacle. Go back to the right to reach the glowing area. Hop into the water and swim to the right to find a hidden area. Smash the right wall to find a room with a Super Mario Bros. 3-esque block. Pass the block for now and smash the right wall in this room.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/44/180201_CI_C4_S16_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThe strawberry will be on the path above you. Use the moving blocks to move around the room to get the fruit. Jump onto the rightward moving block. Make sure to land on the upward block to move it out of the right block\u2019s way.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/f/fe/180201_CI_C4_S16_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nJump and dash up to the leftward block. Ride on this block and jump over any spikes in your way. Dash to the strawberry to collect it.\n\n### Crystal Heart\n\nGrab onto the moving block in the main area of the shrine and weave it to the left around the main obstacle. Go back to the right to reach the glowing area. Hop into the water and swim to the right to find a hidden area. Smash the right wall to find a room with a Super Mario Bros. 3-esque block.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/1/1d/180201_CI_C4_CH_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThis is more than a visual homage to the classic platformer. Just like in SMB3, hold down on the white block until you drop into the background. Using the light pink rocks that made up the background, climb up to the top area of the screen to find the Crystal Heart. Dash into it to collect it.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/1/1f/180201_CI_C4_CH_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nadvertisement\n\n### Strawberry \\#17\n\nDuring the final stretch of the shrine subchapter is where you will find this strawberry. You\u2019ll use a cloud to reach a moving block. You need to weave the block through the obstacles to reach the end. On the path, you will seee the strawberry in a small area above.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/c/c0/180201_CI_C4_S17_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nOn the small stretch of ground before the strawberry, drop down from the platform and grab onto its left side. Jump up and dash through the strawberry and land back on the block to ride it to the right side of the screen.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/0/0f/180201_CI_C4_S17_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n## Old Trail\n\n### Strawberry \\#18\n\nRight at the start of the old trail, use the wind to wall jump up the left wall. At the top is an entry point to a room with a flying strawberry. Use the wind to land on the left wall. Climb up to the height of the strawberry and then dash into it. As you fall, hold grab so that you can grab the right wall and climb to safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/d/d3/180201_CI_C4_S18.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#19\n\nYou can spot this strawberry at the bottom of the screen near the beginning of the Old Trail. Fighting the wind, jump and dash up the the small \"L\" shaped platform up above. Now jump and dash into the bubble. Using the bubble, go to the left to land on the strawberry. Diagonally dash up to grab the column wall and climb to safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/c/c0/180201_CI_C4_S19.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#20\n\nYou can see this strawberry as you ride on a moving block with spikes on the left side. It\u2019ll be at the end of the ride with a bubble leading to safety. While riding the block, you need to use the bubble to replenish your dash. Jump into the bubble and exit to the right, making sure to grab back onto the moving block.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/e/e9/180201_CI_C4_S20.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nRide the block all the way to the right and climb up to collect the strawberry. Drop down and use the wind combined with your dash to get back to the bubble and use it to get to safety.\n\n### Strawberry \\#21\n\nAfter using four moving blocks to navigate a room full of spikes, you\u2019ll see an entry way to the left. It leads to a strawberry room that revolves around wind. A strong leftward wind will be blowing. Use it and a dash to reach the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/7/7b/180201_CI_C4_S21_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nClimb up to the green crystal. Using the crystal, dash diagonally to the second green crystal to refresh your dash. Use this refresh to dash right into the small block.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/4f/180201_CI_C4_S21_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nWait for the second crystal to regenerate. Once it does, jump and dash into the bubble. Exit the bubble to the right and dash immediately to make it to the small column. Make a small up to regenerate your dash. Slide down the column and dash immediately to the right to ensure you land on solid ground.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/5/5e/180201_CI_C4_S21_C.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#22\n\nContinuing up through the room with four moving blocks to navigate through the spikes, you\u2019ll spot this strawberry. It is in a precarious position above spikes with a switch block. Ride the moving block to the right and leap off before it gets to the wall, making sure to stop at the switch. Wait for the switch block to move all the way over. Using the switch itself as a marker, jump off and dash over the spikes to snag the fruit and grab onto the switch block. Quickly climb out and fall to safety before your stamina depletes.\n\nadvertisement\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/3/31/180201_CI_C4_S22.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#23\n\nThis strawberry is in the room with springs at the beginning. You\u2019ll use the springs to reach bubbles and this is where you can spot your target. The strawberry is floating above spikes. You need to time your use of the bubbles to launch at the strawberry and then combining your dash with the wind safely grab onto the wall. Climb into the bubble and launch yourself back down toward the springs to go get Strawberry #24. If you only want/need this strawberry, continue up the screen.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/2/2c/180201_CI_C4_S23.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#24\n\nThis strawberry is in the room with springs at the beginning. You\u2019ll use the springs and wind to launch into the cracked wall on the right. This hidden room is filled with bubbles that you\u2019ll need to use to reach the top. Dash and climb your way up. You can see the strawberry beneath the final bubble. Launch down to the strawberry from the final bubble and grab onto one of the walls to wait for the bubble to return. Then use it to escape the room by going up.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/a/a9/180201_CI_C4_S24.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n## Cliff Face\n\n### Strawberry \\#25\n\nAt the start of the Cliff Face sub-chapter you can see a small crack on the ceiling. Using the cracked rock you can climb up and dash into the hole in the ceiling. Don\u2019t worry if ypu smashed the block. You can still jump and dash your way up there, it\u2019s just a tad trickier.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/5/5c/180201_CI_C4_S25_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThe trick to this strawberry room is to be on the far side of a couple of the moving blocks so that you may reach the far off platforms. Hop onto the left side of the first moving block and move it to the left. When it reaches the top, leap off and dash into the bubble. Exit the bubble to the left and immediately dash upward to avoid the spikes. Grab the wall and hop onto the next moving block.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/46/180201_CI_C4_S25_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nNavigate the block through the hole and then back to the right, moving it to be close to the next block. Jump over to the third block\u2019s right side and execute the same technique as before. At the top jump into the bubble below.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/3/37/180201_CI_C4_S25_C.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nUse the bubble to grab onto the final moving block and ride it halfway up, being mindful of the spikes waiting at the very top. Drop down and dash horizontally through the gap in the spikes to snag the strawberry and land safely.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/0/07/180201_CI_C4_S25_D.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#26\n\nThis strawberry is easy to spot. It can be found floating beneath four disappearing platforms. Fight the wind by jumping and dashing to reach each platform. On the final one, jump back to nab the fruit and then dash upward to ride the wind back to a previous platform.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/c/c5/180201_CI_C4_S26.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#27\n\nWhen giant snowballs start targeting you, then you\u2019ll know you are near this strawberry. Fight the wind and dodge the snowballs as you cross the screen until you spot the fruit near the top. Make your way to the nearby bubble and launch up to float back toward the strawberry. Land on a platform to secure it.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/e/eb/180201_CI_C4_S27.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nadvertisement\n\n### Strawberry \\#28\n\nThis strawberry can be found above the second bubble on the screen after the snowballs. Simply dash up from the second bubble to get the fruit and wait for the bubble to regenerate.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/0/09/180201_CI_C4_S28.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#29\n\nThis strawberry is on the final screen of the chapter. You\u2019ll know you are there when you use a strong rightward wind to leap to bubbles. After passing the spiked column you can see the fruit beneath a bubble and spikes.\n\nUse the closer bubble to launch toward the strawberry. Once you touch it, dash immediately upward to land in the second bubble. From here, exit straight up and ride the wind with one diagonal dash to safely grab the fall and climb to safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/6/66/180201_CI_C4_S29.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Up Next: Chapter 5- Mirror Temple\n\n[Previous\\\n\\\nChapter 3- Celestial Resort](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Chapter_3-_Celestial_Resort) [Next\\\n\\\nChapter 5- Mirror Temple](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Chapter_5-_Mirror_Temple)\n\n### Top Guide Sections\n\n- [Walkthrough](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Walkthrough)\n- [Tips and Tricks](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Tips_and_Tricks)\n- [Strawberries](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Strawberries)\n- [Cassette Tapes](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Cassette_Tapes)\n\n### Was this guide helpful?\n\nLeave feedback\n\n### In This Guide\n\n[![Celeste](https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/01/23/celeste---button-1516746065043.jpg?width=114&crop=1%3A1%2Csmart&auto=webp&dpr=2)](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\n[Celeste](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\n[Matt Makes Games Inc.](https://www.ign.com/games/producer/matt-makes-games-inc) Jan 25, 2018\n\n[Xbox Series X\\|S](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/xbox-4) [Stadia](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/stadia) [Xbox One](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/xbox-one) [PlayStation 4](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/ps4)\n\n+2\n\n[Learn more](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)"

Most of the B-Side's screens (and all of the C-Side's screens) are impossible to navigate without using this maneuver. In the C-Side, the player has to know a technique in which you can re-grab the other side of a space block by holding the climb button and holding the opposite direction it took you.\n\n## **Plot**\\[\\]\n\n**I tried to warn you.**\n\nThis section contains spoilers for Chapter 2: Old Site. Do not read the following section if you wish to avoid spoilers for Chapter 2: Old Site.\n\n[Madeline](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Madeline) awakes to find that several mysterious changes have occurred to her surroundings: the flames of the campfire that she lit [before she went to sleep](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_1#Plot) have turned green, blue lights are descending from the sky, and the text of the [Celeste Memorial](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_1#Plot) is now re-arranging itself at random. Madeline then leaves the Celeste Memorial and starts exploring the surrounding area.\n\nAfter a significant amount of exploring, Madeline encounters a large mirror. As she passes by it, she sees in it a reflection of herself with various features changed (the reflection has purple hair, white skin, and red eyes). Madeline stops after passing by the mirror and walks back over to it, where she again sees this distorted reflection. The reflection then walks over to in front of her, breaks out of the mirror, and runs away. After this occurs, several non-interactive blocks in the level transform into [Star Blocks](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Blocks). Using these Star Blocks, Madeline continues to explore.\n\nNear the Celeste Memorial, Madeline explores a previously-inaccessible area, where she finds her reflection from earlier sitting by a dead campfire. The reflection reveals herself to be not Madeline, but [Part of Madeline](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Part_of_Madeline). The two converse; Part of Madeline attempts to convince Madeline that Madeline should stop climbing Celeste Mountain, saying that it's too difficult a task for Madeline to manage. When Madeline insists that she needs to continue climbing Celeste Mountain, Part of Madeline proposes that the two of them go home together, then begins chasing Madeline through the level.\n\nAfter an intense chase, Part of Madeline stops chasing Madeline and disappears, laughing. Madeline continues running until she encounters a pay-phone, which she observes to be ringing. After some hesitation, Madeline picks up the payphone, and is answered by a green-haired person, who she has an increasingly confusing conversation with. After revealing that they know that Madeline is calling from a payphone, they insist that Madeline called them. Madeline then reveals to them what has just happened to her over the course of the chapter, but they insist that she's making all of it up. As she tries to reveal more of her experiences, she realizes that she's dreaming, which they confirm, then give her more evidence to believe that she's dreaming. Part of Madeline then appears in front of Madeline, telling her that it's time for her to give up and go home, after which the payphone transforms into a giant monster and eats Madeline.\n\nMadeline wakes up to find herself back at the Celeste Memorial, where everything has returned to normal. Madeline then encounters [Theo](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Theo), and they converse briefly. Madeline then continues until she finds the payphone again; she uses this to call her mother, who tries to help Madeline calm down.\n\n**Show/Hide Content**\n\n## **Quotes**\\[\\]\n\n**I tried to warn you.**\n\nThis section contains spoilers for Chapter 2: Old Site.

They unlock each chapter's respective [B-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides#B-Sides). As such, collecting them is required to unlock a chapter's red crystal heart, and all of them must be collected before the C-Sides are unlocked. Cassette Tapes are always in a Cassette Room, featuring [Cassette Blocks](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Block) and an 8-bit remix of the chapter's music. Collecting a Cassette Tape will always lead to Madeline being transported, via bubble, back to the beginning of the room she came from (in [8A](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Core#A-Side) she gets bubbled to the end instead).\n\nAt the level select screen, you can see the checkpoint where the cassette tape (along with strawberries) is found, which can help you locate it.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1Locations of Cassette Tapes](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Locations_of_Cassette_Tapes)\n - [1.1Forsaken City](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Forsaken_City)\n - [1.2Old Site](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Old_Site)\n - [1.3Celestial Resort](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Celestial_Resort)\n - [1.4Golden Ridge](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Golden_Ridge)\n - [1.5Mirror Temple](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Mirror_Temple)\n - [1.6Reflection](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Reflection)\n - [1.7The Summit](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#The_Summit)\n - [1.8Core](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Core)\n- [2Trivia](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Trivia)\n\n## Locations of Cassette Tapes\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=1) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\n**Thou hast been warned!**\n\nThis section contains spoilers for Celeste.

To find it, go past the zipper on the left to reach an optional area, and then stand on the next zipper and launch yourself upwards. It will take you to a berry room. In the wall to the left is the hole, covered by another zip mover. Grab it to get it out of the way, and the cassette room can be found past the gap in the wall.\n\n### [Old Site](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\nIt's found in the Start checkpoint.

After passing through the touch switch room, the next room has a hidden entrance that can be seen in the top-left corner. Use the second white cloud to reach this height, and run to the left of the berry room which takes you to another hidden area with the tape.\n\n### [Mirror Temple](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Mirror_Temple)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=6) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=6)\\]\n\nThis cassette is found in the Depths checkpoint and can be easily missed if you aren't exploring the entire map. After going past two rooms to the right of where you first encounter [Theo](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Theo) in the mirror, fall off the metal platform and take a red booster to the right. Then, pass the next room and the one after it to get to a room with [strawberry seeds](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Strawberry_seeds). Finally, go through a cracked wall on the right to enter the cassette room.\n\n### [Reflection](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Reflection)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=7) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=7)\\]\n\nIt's found in the Hollows checkpoint, behind a breakable wall on the bottom-left side.

Obtaining a chapter's Cassette is required in order to unlock the chapter's B-side level, which uses the mechanics of its respective chapter but is significantly harder.

Clearing this second room by depressing its Dash Switch will open yet another Temple Gate at the bottom right of this following room, leading to a third, more illuminated room. At the bottom right of this third room, the player can simply walk through a section of cracked wall (with or without completing any associated challenges) to access the Cassette room.\n\n## Chapter 6: Reflection\\[\\]\n\nThis Cassette can be found in the first room of this chapter's third sub-chapter, \"Hollows\". To access the Cassette room, the player must use the nearby [Kevin Block](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Kevin_Blocks) to break the wall below it and send the Block to the bottom of the lake. The player must then quickly attack the Kevin Block again to make it break the wall to its left, exposing the entryway into the Cassette room.\n\n## Chapter 7: The Summit\\[\\]\n\nThis chapter's Cassette can be found in its fourth sub-chapter, \"1500M\". Upon entering this sub-chapter's fifth room, an opening can be seen leading out the top of the room.

These remixes are known as [Celeste B-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_B-Sides), although the exact same soundtrack plays in C-Sides as well.\n\nAlternate sides do not have any [Red Strawberries](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Collectables#Red_Strawberries), but [Golden Strawberries](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Strawberries) can be found and collected there if they have been unlocked and the alternate side has been completed before.\n\nAdditionally, alternate sides of all levels will be instantly unlocked when [Cheat Mode](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cheat_Mode) is enabled in the save file.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1B-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides#B-Sides)\n- [2C-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides#C-Sides)\n- [3Trivia](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides#Trivia)\n- [4References](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides#References)\n\n## B-Sides\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides?veaction=edit&section=1) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides?action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/4/4a/Red_crystal_heart_asset.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Red_crystal_heart_asset.png) A Red Crystal Heart\n\nA B-Side for a given chapter can be unlocked by collecting a [Cassette Tape](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape) in the A-Side of the level.

Here the Crystal Heart puzzle begins.\n\nThe computer will flash a sequence of colors; nearby, there will be a number of small, colored birds, each of whom corresponds with a color that the computer flashes. The computer will flash a series of colors intermittently, followed by the birds all moving in different directions. To obtain the heart, one must pay attention to the sequence of colors that the computer flashes, as well as the directions that the birds move in every time the sequence finishes. The player must dash in the direction that each bird corresponds to in the order in the computer's light sequence where that bird's color appears on the computer (in relation to the other colors, not in real time). The direction sequence that the player must perform is:\n\n[![Celeste Birds](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e7/Celeste_Birds.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20201006071705)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e7/Celeste_Birds.png/revision/latest?cb=20201006071705)\n\nColor Directions\n\n- Up (White)\n- Left (Purple)\n- Down-Right (Blue)\n- Up-Right (Red)\n- Left (Purple)\n- Up-Left (Yellow)\n\nPerforming this series of dashes will cause the birds to form into this chapter's Crystal Heart (entitled _Pointless machines_) which the player can then obtain.\n\n## Chapter 2\\[\\]\n\n[![Resurrections](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/5/5e/Resurrections.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213173921)\n\nResurrections\n\nThe Crystal Heart in this chapter is located in [Chapter 2](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_2)'s first sub-chapter, [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Old_Site)). In theory, this Crystal Heart should be quite easy to locate, being two screens up from the starting screen of the chapter. In practice, it is very difficult to locate, as there are no [objects](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Objects) that will help one to get there. One of the ways to get there is by exploiting a piece of the game's physics that recharges the player's dash when the player moves from one screen to another. This mechanic is not directly taught in the game (although it is indirectly taught when the player attempts to collect an early strawberry in [Chapter 3](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_3:_Celestial_Resort)), and for this reason, it is regarded by many as one of the hardest Crystal Hearts to find without a guide. The mechanic allows the player to essentially climb thin air by dashing off of the right side of the first screen onto the second screen, then back, repeating until the player moves up to the screen above the first screen. After climbing up a wall from this third screen onto a fourth screen, the player can then fall down onto the third screen, dash onto the fourth screen, and repeat until one\u00a0finds a wall. The player can then climb this wall, after which the player can easily reach the topmost screen, where one can simply walk over to this chapter's Crystal Heart (entitled _Resurrections_) and obtain it.\n\nAnother way to get to this crystal heart is to first get onto the second screen, climb up the wall, stand on the left edge of the platform above the second screen, jump to the far left of the platform and then dash left as soon as the player leaves the screen. By doing so, the player lands on the platform on the left and can then continue climbing up towards the crystal heart.\n\nThe heart can also be seen (but not obtained) in the [Awake](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Awake) subchapter of Chapter 2, where it is easier to locate, and a poem lies near it with hints of how to obtain it:\n\n_An apparition_\n\n_Not of this world_\n\n_But because of it_\n\n_Lurking_ _**out of frame**_\n\n_Awake, my heart is a fortress_\n\n_**In dreams I am vulnerable**_\n\n## Chapter 3\\[\\]\n\n[![Scattered and lost](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/7/7f/Scattered_and_lost.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213174144)\n\nScattered and lost\n\nThe Crystal Heart in [Chapter 3](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_3)\u00a0is located in the second sub-chapter, [Huge Mess](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Huge_Mess). After being tasked to help clean up by Mr. Oshiro, the player must advance to the lower path of the two in the upper right corner. Once the player reaches and activates the large button to clear the purple and white towels, one must\u00a0advance not to the left as usual, but to the right. The player must then travel\u00a0up into the crevice that a stream of water is falling out of to\u00a0reveal a secret path, leading back to one of the earlier rooms of the path. One must then advance upwards and then to the left (in reverse of the way the player first goes through the area) until the player reaches the first room, where the player first runs into Theo in Chapter 3. There is a path at the top of the screen that was previously blocked by towels; the player must dash up to this path and follow it upward to find this chapter's Crystal Heart (entitled _Scattered and lost_) and obtain it.\n\n## Chapter 4\\[\\]\n\n[![Eye of the storm](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e4/Eye_of_the_storm.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213174319)\n\nEye of the storm\n\n[Chapter 4](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_4)'s Crystal Heart is located at the very beginning of the second sub-chapter, [Shrine](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Shrine). To reach the Crystal Heart, the player must cling to the [Guided Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Guided_Platforms), then navigate it left to avoid hitting the wall, after which the player should move it back to the right. Once the player lands, the player must go to the right, into the lit up area. Once one goes into the next room, the player should see a waterfall pouring into a pool of [water](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Water). The player must then swim towards the bottom right corner, and keep swimming to the right until the player reaches a hidden area with a strawberry. The player must then dash into the [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls) to the right to break it, after which the player should reach a tall room. One cannot reach the top normally; the player must crouch on top of the room's idiosyncratic white block until the player disappears. The player is now in the background instead of the foreground, thus allowing one to interact with objects in the background (a trick borrowed from [Super Mario Bros. 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3), which has a similar block with a similar gimmick). This object interaction allows the player to climb to the top of the screen, where the Crystal Heart (entitled _Eye of the storm_) is located.\n\n## Chapter 5\\[\\]\n\n[![Quiet and falling](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e2/Quiet_and_falling.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175216)\n\nQuiet and falling\n\n[Chapter 5](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_5)'s Crystal Heart is located in the second sub-chapter, [Depths](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Depths). After getting the key above the statue, the player must enter the room beneath the statue to the right, then hop on the nearby bubble and travel to the right. Instead of opening the door at the end of the room, the player must enter a second bubble and travel to the left, then dash up into the center of the second platform on their way back. This moves the player into a third bubble that they can use to travel upwards, leading to a secret path above the door. After making their way through the long hallway to reach the next room and going through that room as normal, the player must now head to the bottom of the following room and dash downwards to break the brown [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls) in the floor. This reveals another locked door that they can use the key on, which leads to the Crystal Heart's room. In order to navigate in the room, one must go along the outer edges of the room, using a set of moving blocks and platforms to get to the Crystal Heart (entitled _Quiet and falling_) and obtain it.\n\n## Chapter 6\\[\\]\n\n[![Heavy and frail](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/4/4d/Heavy_and_frail.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175253)\n\nHeavy and frail\n\n[Chapter 6](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_6:_Reflection)'s Crystal Heart is located at the beginning of the third sub-chapter, [Hollows](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Hollows). At the start of the sub-chapter, the player must use the [Angry Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Angry_Platforms) to break through the wall below to get to the first [Feather](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Feathers). One must then use it to fly up-right, and then dash down to break the [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls), revealing the second Feather. The player must use that Feather to fly upwards, then climb to the third Feather, and finally use that Feather to fly to the left of the screen, revealing an entrance to a secret room. After going through the room and breaking another Smashable Wall, the player will see a puzzle with a statue, 6 colored crystals, 4 torches and 3 symbols.\n\n[![Celeste Birds](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e7/Celeste_Birds.png/revision/latest?cb=20201006071705)\n\nBird Color Directions (see Chapter 1)\n\nIn order to solve the puzzle, one must repeat the pattern required to obtain the first chapter's Crystal Heart; doing so correctly will light up the first torch. The same thing must be done for the rest, but with slight alterations for each following torch: the second torch's pattern must be the first, but mirrored left-right (e.g an up-left on the first torch must be an up-right dash for the second); the third torch's pattern has to be mirrored up-down (e.g. an upwards dash on the first must be a downwards dash for the third), and the fourth one's pattern must be mirrored both up-down and left-right (e.g. an up-left dash on the first must be a down-right dash for the fourth). For a complete list of directions, see below:\n\n- First torch: Up, Left, Down-Right, Up-Right, Left, Up-Left\n- Second torch: Up, Right, Down-Left, Up-Left, Right, Up-Right\n- Third torch: Down, Left, Up-Right, Down-Right, Left, Down-Left\n- Fourth torch: Down, Right, Up-Left, Down-Left, Right, Down-Right\n\nAfter lighting up all 4 torches, the Crystal Heart (entitled _Heavy and frail_) will be granted on top of the statue.\n\n## Chapter 7\\[\\]\n\n[![Pink sunrise](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/c/c3/Pink_sunrise.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175701)\n\nPink sunrise\n\nTo obtain the crystal heart in [Chapter 7](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_7), you must find six Jewels hidden in each subchapter\u2014 a blue star for Reflection at the [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(The_Summit)), a sapphire square for Forsaken City at [500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/500_M), an emerald oval for Old Site at [1000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/1000_M), a gold circle for Celestial Resort at [1500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/1500_M), a pink diamond for Golden Ridge at [2000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2000_M), and a white pearl for Mirror Temple at [2500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2500_M). You obtain the crystal heart in [3000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/3000_M) after getting all the Jewels.\n\n#### Star\\[\\]\n\nThe first Jewel is located at the end of the last screen of the Start subchapter. After bouncing off of the last\u00a0[Spring](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Springs), the player must use both dashes to jump over the final\u00a0[Purple Orb](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Purple_Orbs), then climb up the wall on the right. The screen should move, revealing the first Jewel.\n\n#### Sapphire\\[\\]\n\nThe route to 500 M's Jewel starts in the sub-chapter's 3rd screen, where, after going up on the first\u00a0[Traffic Light Block](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Traffic_Light_Blocks), the player must go left instead of going right at the intersection. The player should then go right after climbing to the top of the tall screen that follows. In the following room, just to the right of the second Traffic Light Block, there is a tiny gap in the ground, which the player must fall through to find the room with the second Jewel. Completing the\u00a0spike-lined obstacle course will allow the player to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Emerald\\[\\]\n\nFor 1000 M's Jewel, the player must go through the upper left or upper right route of the 5th screen of the subchapter. If you choose the upper left route, you have to go up through the first [Space Block](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Blocks), then use the Space Block on the right to break a [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls). You will then enter into a room with a strawberry. Going up through the spiked platform will lead you to the path to the Jewel. Going the upper right route will skip the berry. The player must dash to the right in the middle of two Space Blocks to break a Smashable Wall; breaking this wall will reveal another room with [Skull Binoculars](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Skull_Binoculars), as well as with a concealed\u00a0[Disappearing Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Disappearing_Platforms) which the player must stand on to fall to the chamber below. Completing this chamber will allow the player to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Gold\\[\\]\n\n1500 M's Jewel is at the end of the 7th screen of the subchapter and is probably the easiest one to find. Below the exit upwards into the 8th screen, a broken wall can be seen. Going through there and completing the room that it reveals will allow the player to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Diamond\\[\\]\n\n2000 M's Jewel is a trek to get to. To the left of the second room is a seemingly pointless room. In one of the gaps above the player (the widest one above the pit of\u00a0[Crystal Spikes](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_Spikes)), there is a secret platform to stand on, which the player can use to jump all the way to the left of the screen. In the next screen, there is a broken area of the roof, providing another entrance to a secret platform. The player must get there, jump off to the left, dash up to the left, and then dash up as soon as the player is past the wall that they need to climb up. Going up through the hole will reveal the Jewel.\n\n#### Pearl\\[\\]\n\nTo reach 2500 M's Jewel, the player must take the first\u00a0Red Bubble\u00a0left, causing it to break the wall at the left of the first screen. The player must then enter the Red Bubble in the newly revealed screen and take that to the right, causing it to break several more walls before it eventually stops moving. The player must then go up and complete the following screen to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Crystal Heart\\[\\]\n\nAt checkpoint 28 at 3000 M, the player must dash under the gap in the wall to the player's right, causing the camera to move and reveal the room with the Crystal Heart. If the player has all of the Jewels, they will pop out of the floor, and the Crystal Heart (entitled _Pink sunrise_) will move to a place where the player can obtain it.\n\n## Chapter 8\\[\\]\n\n[![Heart of the Mountain](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/1/19/Heart_of_the_Mountain.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175751)\n\nHeart of the mountain\n\nThe Crystal Heart in [Chapter 8](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_8) is the most straightforward to obtain, as it is required to obtain at the end of the fourth subchapter, [Heart of the Mountain](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Mountain), to complete the chapter.

Many of them serve\u00a0different purposes and some of them can only be found in specific places, adding for an extra challenge for players who are willing to conquer it.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1Strawberries](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Strawberries)\n - [1.1Red Strawberry](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Red_Strawberry)\n - [1.1.1Strawberry Seeds](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Strawberry_Seeds)\n - [1.2Winged Strawberry](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Winged_Strawberry)\n - [1.3Golden Strawberry](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Golden_Strawberry)\n - [1.4Winged Golden Strawberry](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Winged_Golden_Strawberry)\n - [1.5Moon Berry](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Moon_Berry)\n- [2Crystal Hearts](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Crystal_Hearts)\n- [3Cassettes](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Cassettes)\n- [4Trivia](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Trivia)\n\n## Strawberries\\[\\]\n\nStrawberries are basic collectibles that can be found in every chapter and they appear in several different types. They don't serve any sort of purpose apart from giving the player an extra challenge and to fill up stats. Collecting 175 strawberries however, unlocks the \"Impress Your Friends\" achievement. The amount of collected Strawberries also affect which ending the player will get in [Epilogue](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Epilogue). The game has 202 total strawberries (175 Red Strawberries, 26 Golden Strawberries And 1 Moon Berry).\n\n### Red Strawberry\\[\\]\n\nStrawberry.\n\nRed Strawberries are the most common berry in the game. They appear in every A-Side, with the exception of [Chapter 6: Reflection](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_6:_Reflection), and the DLC chapter, [Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_9:_Farewell). They appear in many rooms, including hidden areas that normally aren't required to progress. Upon collecting, it follows the player unless they remain on safe ground for a small amount of time. It is possible to stop berries from collecting, which can allow the player to start a chain of strawberries. When collecting strawberries, they will give a score of 1000. Collecting multiple strawberries at once will increase the score to 2000, then 3000, then 4000, then 5000, before then giving a 1UP. Getting a 1UP will unlock its corresponding achievement, but this scoring has no other effects.\n\n#### Strawberry Seeds\\[\\]\n\nStrawberry Seeds are small yellow-green collectibles that are scattered around a single room. Collected seeds respawn once the player touches the ground. Collecting all seeds in a room without touching the ground causes the seeds to combine into a Red Strawberry. If the player dies after unlocking the berry, it will remain. These strawberry seeds are only found in chapters 2, 4, 5, and 7.\n\n### Winged Strawberry\\[\\]\n\nWinged Strawberries are an uncommon type of Red Strawberries that fly away after a dash is used. Winged Strawberries will respawn if the player retries the room. Winged Strawberries lose their wings if the player touches/collects them. Most of the time, these strawberries are obtainable only by completing the room without dashing, but some require a dash to grab them before they fly away.\n\n### Golden Strawberry\\[\\]\n\nGolden Strawberries are special collectibles that can be unlocked when the player has completed Core B-Side. They appear only in chapters that have been completed before, and in order to collect them, the player has to take them to the end of the level in without dying once. Every chapter has one Golden Strawberry, and they're considered one of the biggest challenges in the entire game. Golden Strawberries can only be collected if the player grabs the Crystal Heart in B-Sides and C-Sides, or if they get to a room that triggers its collection in the A-Sides. If the player dies while carrying a Golden Strawberry, they will be taken back to the place where the berry normally appears.\n\n- A-Side collection rooms:\n - Forsaken City: Final room (cutscene entry not required)\n - Old Site: Final room of Intervention (cutscene entry not required)\n - Celestial Resort: Final room (cutscene entry required)\n - Golden Ridge: Final room (cutscene entry not required)\n - Mirror Temple: Final room (cutscene entry not required, Theo Crystal not required)\n - Reflection: Final room of Rock Bottom (cutscene entry not required)\n - Summit: Final room, final checkpoint (collected after the final set of spikes, cutscene entry not required)\n - Core: Final room (Crystal Heart not required)\n\n### Winged Golden Strawberry\\[\\]\n\nThe Winged Golden Strawberry is a hidden secret that can only be found at the end of [Chapter 1A](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_1:_Forsaken_City) if the player has completed the entire chapter without dashing even once. If the player enters a screen transition after using a dash to complete a room, the berry will disappear (this can be avoided by dying after accidentally using a dash). Completing the chapter without dashing takes advantage of obscure techniques such as spike jumping, neutral jumping, etc. (more explained in [Moves](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Moves)). Unlike other Golden Strawberries, the player isn't required to complete everything without dying.\n\n### Moon Berry\\[\\]\n\n**I tried to warn you.**\n\nThis section contains spoilers for the Moon Berry and Chapter 9. Do not read the following section if you wish to avoid spoilers for the Moon Berry and Chapter 9.\n\nThe Moon Berry is a hidden collectible found at the very end of Chapter 9: Farewell. It's found in the last sub-chapter, where the player has to take an alternative path after destroying the lightning source. It takes the player to a secret area, which is an extra challenge for players who have already beaten the chapter. It behaves very similarly to a normal berry, however upon collecting, it unlocks the \"Wow\" achievement.\n\n**Show/Hide Content**\n\n## Crystal Hearts\\[\\]\n\nBlue Crystal Heart.\n\nCrystal Hearts are collectibles that can be found in every chapter. They appear in different colours which resemble the Alternate Side the player has played. There are 24 total Crystal Hearts, and a grey fake Crystal Heart that can be found right before the Event Horizon sub-chapter of Farewell. Red and Golden Crystal Hearts appear at the end of their corresponding B-Sides and C-Sides, while Blue Crystal Hearts are hidden and require the player to solve a puzzle or find a secret area (with the exception being [Chapter 8: Core](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_8:_Core)). Colours vary depending on the type of chapter you're playing:\n\n- A-Sides:\n- B-Sides:\n- C-Sides:\n- Farewell:\n\nCrystal Hearts are required in order to unlock certain areas in the game. Their amount is different depending on the area a player is trying to unlock, regardless of the colour of them:\n\n- Core A-Side: at least 4 Crystal Hearts\n- Core B-Side: 15 Crystal Hearts (All Crystal Hearts before it.)\n- Core C-Side: 23 Crystal Hearts (All Crystal Hearts before it.)\n- Farewell (Event Horizon): 15 Crystal Hearts (skippable, see [Chapter 9: Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_9:_Farewell#Heart_Gate_Skip) for more details)\n\n## Cassettes\\[\\]\n\nCassettes are collectibles that can be found in every A-Side in the game, with the exception being Chapter 9. Cassettes appear in rooms that are built around coloured Rhythm Blocks that the player has to time to the music in order to progress. Collecting them unlocks the B-Side, which is a more difficult version of the regular chapter. Although Cassettes are optional collectibles, finding them is required in order to gain every Crystal Heart in the game.\n\nUpon collecting a Cassette, a preview of the B-Side music is played, and after pressing a key, the player is transported to the spawn point of the room.\n\n## Trivia\\[\\]\n\n- There's a lot of very interesting early concept ideas from the [developer stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-nSjhIgmXc%7C), where Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry discussed about a lot of ideas that were changed over time or ideas that were scrapped or replaced with something else in the official version:\n - Before Crystal Hearts were added, there were black heart pieces that appeared in their place and they filled a black heart shape upon collection, which could eventually unlock Core and other areas.\n - When Strawberry Seeds were being created, their appearance was being changed a lot, and at first they used to be gem pieces or music notes, that would eventually unlock the B-Sides (back then named Remixes) upon collection. Once actual Cassettes were added, the idea of obtaining them was made much simplier, and shards were changed into seeds that would unlock Red Strawberries upon collecting.\n - There were journal pages that would explain lore regarding the Celeste Mountain, and the player would be required to take them all to an NPC who would decipher them. The idea never made it, as it might have ruined the mysterious feeling of the mountain.\n- If you take the Golden Strawberry into the Moon Berry room in Chapter 9, it will detach from the player and wait at the next spawn point, as there's a forced death spot. Once respawning, the player would be able to grab the berry again.\n- If you manage to chain 6 strawberries, the \"score\" sprite will increase up to an 1-UP, unlocking an achievement.\n - Golden Strawberries also have their own 1-UP sound, similar to their own collection noise.\n\nCommunity content is available under [CC-BY-SA](https://www.fandom.com/licensing) unless otherwise noted.\n\nAdvertisement"

It is a challenge that tests your skill, consistency, patience, and perseverance to conquer what is often the final mountain players encounter in the game.

They may help you with issues like nerve control or consistency issues.\n\n### Do low death runs\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=2) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nSince Farewell is a tough chapter, your first run will usually have a fairly large death count, often above 3,000. Finishing the chapter multiple times will show your general progress and give you a view on what rooms you have to improve on, or what's your current choke point. Once you get to a really low total death count (20 or less), these runs become rather obsolete, however it's useful to do at least one of them to see what checkpoints you need more practice on.\n\n### Practice deathless checkpoints\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\nThe next step is to be able to consistently pass through entire subchapters without dying once. Play through them multiple times, mess around with strategies and check what causes the most amount of deaths on your runs, and try to improve on them. Here's a recommended priority for checkpoints:\n\n- **Event Horizon**: One of the hardest checkpoints, although it is fairly straightforward for most of the time, but some rooms require a decent amount of precision, therefore requiring a bit of practice to get your muscle memory down.\n- **Determination**: usually the biggest choke point on golden runs. It's less precise than Event Horizon for most of the time, but it has several rooms that contain cycles or quick movement that can be difficult to get used to.\n- **Reconciliation**: although it's not particularly difficult until the last few rooms, it's a really long and stressful section, especially so far into a run. Great checkpoint to practice some nerve control, as it's the longest one and it has a couple choke points.\n- **Remembered**: has a couple tricky rooms that can be annoying to deal with, so it's recommended to do a few runs of it to be able to pass it consistently. Dying in Remembered often feels frustrating for players, as it's past the Power Source skip, but not far enough to get to the hardest parts of the chapter.\n- **Stubbornness**: despite it's length, it has three rooms that can be difficult to get used to (ST-2, ST-4 and ST-7). It's highly recommended to play through the final room multiple times, as it's very easy to mess it up. Don't rush as you might end up missing a cycle.\n- **Farewell**: it's only a single room (unless you're planning to get the Moon Berry as well), but for as far as it is, nerves will make this room a lot more intimidating. You need to be able to consistently first try this room, or else you need more practice.\n- **Power Source**: there's not much else to practice than the key skip itself. Try to get used to the Jellyvators, as the dashes are 3 frame inputs.\n- **Singular**: basically no need to practice this checkpoint as it's the very beginning of your run. You'll get better at it the more runs you do.\n\n### Do not overcomplicate things\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=4) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\nA lot of deaths in golden runs are caused by doing overly difficult strategies a player isn't consistent with, or done for the sake of going faster. If you're not comfortable with speedrunning or fast strats, don't go for them as they will waste a lot of your attempts. If you get far into a run, try to avoid as many unnecessary inputs as possible. A lot of players for example avoid doing Jellyvators far into a run, as with nerves it's easy to accidentally fail the neutral drop. Another example is to wait for the [Crystal Heart Gate](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart_Gate) to open, instead of using the speedrun strategy to bypass it.\n\n### Use the Debug Map\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=5) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=5)\\]\n\n_Disclaimer: the Debug Map is only available in the PC versions of Celeste! (sorry console players)_\n\n[Debug Mode](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Debug_Mode) has an option to enable the Debug Map which shows the layout of the entire chapter, allowing you to teleport to any spawn point you want. It's a big quality of life improvement, as it allows practicing certain rooms without having to go back, or restarting the entire checkpoint. It becomes very handy for practicing Determination, as it has multiple cycle based rooms, and debug spawns allow you to spawn right before a room to practice them from entry.\n\nAn alternate way to practice entry cycles is to enable [Assist Mode](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Assist_Mode) on consoles and to fly through the rooms backwards with invincibility enabled. Unfortunately this method doesn't work with the Reconciliation checkpoint due to the inability to go back.\n\n### Keep your own pace\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=6) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=6)\\]\n\nDon't feel forced or rushed to complete the run, as it may eventually lead to frustration or demotivation. Everyone learns at their own pace, and it's important to be prepared for runs. Don't force yourself to play on an off day, and instead take some time off from the grind, or instead do something less stressful such as deathless checkpoints or rooms. This will help you maintain your muscle memory, while not trying to force yourself too hard to the grind.\n\n## Major strategies\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=7) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=7)\\]\n\nThese strats are dedicated to some of the trickier rooms of Farewell and are generally useful for safety, or to make infamous rooms less intimidating.\n\n### Oil skip\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=8) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=8)\\]\n\nSee also: [Farewell: Oil Skip](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell#Oil_Skip)\n\nOil skip allows you to have two dashes for the majority of the chapter. The glitch is performed in _Start_, allowing you to bypass the dash count trigger located in Farewell's first \"space\" room.\n\n### Power Source key skip\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=9) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=9)\\]\n\nSee also: [Farewell Speedrun Strategies: Power Source Key Skip](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell#Speedrun_Strategies)\n\nWhile the key skip isn't mandatory for the golden run, and for some people it might be harder due to the [Jellyvators](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Vator?action=edit&redlink=1) leading to the skip being rather tight, the significant timesave it gives makes the beginning faster by a fair amount. Since you'll be going through Singular and Power Source a lot, any form of timesave will reduce the tedium of repeating the beginning over and over.\n\nIf you're not comfortable with the Jellyvator, you can take the red bubble to the right, grab the pink refill and use it to reach the Power Box. There will be another Jellyfish on the left side of the hub, so you'll be able to do the Jellyvators anyway.\n\nAfter leaving the hub, there's two effective ways to go through the tight gap in the alternate path:\n\n- Stand on the edge of the left platform while holding a jelly, immediately jump while holding right to jump right into the entrance, and once you go past the tight obstacle, throw the jelly and immediately do a down-right dash. The window for the dash is lenient, so if you get used to the timing, the risk of dying is very low.\n- Once you reach the entrance to the alternate path, grab onto the right wall, slowly move down to the previous room so [Madeline](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Madeline) stays at the top of the previous room, and then jump as close as possible to the end of the screen. The room transition causes Madeline to do a small jump which sets you up very well for a diagonal dash.\n\nThe rest of the alternate path is very straightforward.\n\n### Sawmill room skip\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=10) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=10)\\]\n\nThe 4th room of Remembered (often referred as \"Sawmill room\") can be done in an alternate way by taking the jellyfish from the previous room. It allows you to entirely skip the tricky walljumps by bouncing off of the springs and using the refills for your advantage to float with the jelly through the room. Be aware of the killboxes which appear after passing through one of the falling pillars, they can kill you if unaware. Due to the floatiness of the item, using a spring will bounce you pretty far so be prepared to hold towards the pillar or else it will bounce you right into spikes.\n\nThe strategy is not very intuitive due to the killboxes and the jellyfish momentum, but it gives more freedom and more room for error instead of the intended way.\n\n### Wavedash.ppt wallbounces\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=11) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=11)\\]\n\nBoth wallbounces in wavedash.ppt have strategies that make the rooms more manageable and the wallbounces less likely to be missed. For the first one, grab onto the wall on top of the spring, wait for the floating block to move down, fall directly on top of the spring and it will make the wallbounce a bit easier and more consistent to do.\n\nFor the second one, you don't need to do chain the Wavedashes. Get to the small platform, stand on the left side of it and do an Extended Hyper to the right, and if you jump from the edge of the platform, you'll not fall into the pit, and instead you'll grab the bottom side of the giant wall. After that, jump away to the left and you'll be able to reach the wallbounce from there, and it's much more forgiving than the intended way.\n\n### \"Haircut\" strategy\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=12) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=12)\\]\n\nThe coins in the first Event Horizon autoscroller can be skipped entirely by grabbing the two bottom pixels of the moving platform, allowing Madeline to move past the wall of spikes without getting hurt. The correct pixels can be noticed with an easy visual cue which is Madeline's hand animation. If the hand is only two pixels big, you're not low enough to avoid the spikes, but if it's 3-4 pixels, you're safe.\n\nAfter dodging the spike wall, you don't even have to collect the coins. Because you'll still have the double dash, you can just quickly climb back up, and then drop and dash towards the green refill, and reach safe ground.\n\n### Comb room Superdash\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=13) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=13)\\]\n\nIt's possible to reach the distance for the infamous comb room (second autoscroller in Event Horizon) by performing an Extended [Superdash](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Superdashes) instead of a [Wavedash](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Wavedashes). Because it gives Madeline less momentum, you'll have slightly more time to react to the wallbounce. However, in order to not hit your head against the large spike comb, try to jump off of the gray block at the edge of the platform. If you jump too early, you'll most likely hit the hanging spinner wall. Due to the fact a Superdash gives you less momentum, you'll have to perform it slightly earlier than a Wavedash.\n\n### DT-5 Superdash\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=14) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=14)\\]\n\nNormally the \"intended\" strategy to get the coin in the 5th room of Determination is to do a Wavedash and hold back to not let momentum fling you into spikes, however the distance sets you up perfectly for an Extended Super. It's much safer and more intuitive.\n\nAn alternate way to get it is to grab on the lowest tile of the top gate which is not covered by spinners. If you're low enough, you can jump away to the right and collect the coin.\n\n### Core block room cycle\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=15) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=15)\\]\n\nThe easiest way to be completely sure the stars won't get in your way, is to enter the room and immediately do an Extended Hyper to the Core Block. The stars are set up to work with an entry cycle.\n\nFor the stamina puzzle, the main strategy is to avoid as many climb jumps as possible, and to jump away from walls if you can. If you jump to the wall with the pink crystal, avoid climbing up immediately, as with bad luck, you can activate the dust obstacles before you get to grab onto the wall. Jumping to the right platform is much safer.\n\n### Starshaft safe cycle\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=16) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=16)\\]\n\nThe falling star room (commonly referred as \"Starshaft\") in Determination can be passed fairly safely with two strategies that have relatively safe cycles:\n\n- The first strategy is to do a Wavedash or Hyper from the very end of the previous room, which will transition Madeline and she will jump right into the tunnel entrance. This strategy has an awkward start and it might require a little more dodging, but because you do the move from the previous screen, the cycle will always be the same.\n- The second strategy is to enter the room normally, wait for the stars to move right and perform an Extended Superdash when the stars are about to move left. The cycle on this is often very lenient, however it's also a bit relient on your timing, so it's not recommended if you don't have a cue for this jump.\n\n### Conveyor room neutrals/ending\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=17) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=17)\\]\n\nIf you're consistent with [Neutral Jumping](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Neutrals), it's usually safe to use them to jump away from the icy walls as a Wallbounce can be missed, or the dash can be used to recorrect your position if needed.\n\nThe end of the room looks scary, but the moving gate sets it up very well. Do not enter the top-right entrance, where the sneak peek of the next room is, as it will despawn the gate and it will move back to the initial position. Grab onto the gate, fall on it, and when close to the entrance, you can just press right for a little bit and then dash right. With the setup, the dash, while still fairly stressful, it's not as tight as without the setup.\n\n### Final DT room cycle\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=18) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=18)\\]\n\nA common cycle setup for the star flight is to either slowly walk towards the feather and dash into it when in the dash range, or to [Ultradash](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Ultradashes) from the previous room:\n\n- If you walk slowly, you have to watch out for your movement. If you move fairly confidently and quickly, the cycles will be relatively easy to dodge by just wiggling up and down a little bit during the fast wind. The rest gives you a lot of reaction time.\n- The Ultra strategy can make the cycle very easy, allowing the player to move through most of the stars with barely moving at all, however the Ultra needs to be fairly quick in order for the cycle to work.\n\nAt the end of the room, it's recommended to grab the Badeline Orb from the bottom. It often delays the cycle a tiny bit, making it less likely to get hit by the stars. If you think you're way off cycle, you can slow the feather down and dash into the orb if needed, however that strategy is fairly risky. Use it only if you get way too offcycle.\n\n### ST-2 spring\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=19) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=19)\\]\n\nThe blue spring block has a rather tight window which can be a common choke point. There's two cues for the spring timing:\n\n- Grab onto the top of the green block and jump right after the middle tick. You'll bounce on the spring and the block should disappear shortly after hitting the spring again.\n- Hold onto the green block and jump to the left wall of the small blue block. You can either slowly climb towards the spring or do a max height jump to reach the spring. For the jump, try to do it as the last tick is ending, however for the climb you might want to do it a little earlier.\n\n### ST-7 ending\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=20) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=20)\\]\n\nThe end of ST-7 can be done without the need of the double dash, however it's a bit harder and somewhat risky. It's however recommended to have it as an alternate strategy in case if you miss grabbing the pink block back, or if you tried to save yourself in any other way. Since Cassette Blocks don't appear when Madeline is inside them, you can hold onto the yellow block and jump, then dash up-right through the tall blue block right after the second tick. You'll be able to reach the small spring block at the end without the need of a double dash.\n\n### RC-1 cycle\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=21) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=21)\\]\n\nThe first obstacle can be done by doing an Extended Hyper or Wavedash at the second tick. For the second obstacle it's safer to do an Extended Super instead, as it's slightly slower, allowing you to reach the bird with less risk of hitting the spikes.\n\n### Windfeather setup\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=22) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=22)\\]\n\nIn RC-15 (also known as \"Windfeather\") you can crouch to stop getting pushed by wind, and do a Reverse Hyper into a right dash to set up your height perfectly. Be sure that you managed to do a full Hyperdash in order to set up the positioning well.\n\n### Chokefish save\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=23) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=23)\\]\n\nIf you accidentally explode the first Pufferfish after being tossed by the bird in RC-16 (commonly referred as \"Chokefish\"), you can move back to the left and wait for them to respawn. A Wavedash or Extended Hyper reaches far enough to do this room without the need of the bird.\n\n## Extra strategies\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=24) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=24)\\]\n\nSmaller strategies for easier rooms that can be used to reduce the risk of dying, or to make passing through them quicker.\n\n### Singular\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=25) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=25)\\]\n\n### Power Source\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=26) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=26)\\]\n\n### Remembered\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=27) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=27)\\]\n\n### Event Horizon\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=28) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=28)\\]\n\n### Determination\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=29) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=29)\\]\n\n### Stubbornness\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=30) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=30)\\]\n\n### Reconciliation\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=31) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=31)\\]\n\n### Farewell & Gold Berry Room\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?veaction=edit&section=32) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell_Golden_Strawberry_strategy_guide?action=edit&section=32)\\]\n\nThe most important thing to do in this room is to calm down.

I mean, just look at Monika's D-sides. 4D\n\nis a mess!\n\nMadeline: Eh, maybe it\u2019s not THAT bad\u2026 Hey, on the topic of the D-sides,\n\nI\u2019ve noticed something interesting.\n\nBadeline: Hmm? What\u2019s on your mind?\n\nMadeline: There\u2019s no such thing as \u201c7B1D\u201d.\n\nBadeline: What do you mean? Mind explaining?\n\nMadeline: So.. 7D, right? The Summit D-side. Someone decided to be a bit\n\nexperimental, and create 7D with Single Dash, also known as 7D 1 Dash,\n\nor 7D1D.\n\nBadeline: Neat. So I\u2019m assuming that 7B1D refers to 7B with Single Dash?\n\nMadeline: Affirmative. Strangely, There exists a 7A1D and 7C1D, yet there\u2019s\n\nno 7B1D.\n\nBadeline: Huh. That\u2019s\u2026 somewhat interesting. Thank you for the insight, I\n\nhope someone makes it soon. I love 7B, It\u2019s a fairly fun level.\n\nMadeline: \u2026You haven\u2019t even played 7B as of now within the story.\n\nBadeline: \u2026And?\n\nMadeline: \u2026Good point. Wait, why are we using actual grammar? This is a\n\npost written by Juke\u2019s Towers of Hell Wiki User \u201cNotGettino1st\u201d, for crying\n\nout loud!\n\nBadeline: I.. don\u2019t know. Maybe that one \u201cCyanDizzy\u201d dude that appeared before has something to do with it. Ah well, let\u2019s just continue on.\n\n2500m:\n\nMadeline: I LOVE SWAP BLOCKS! THEY SO GOODY..>.\n\nBadeline: k. Cool. i agree. They remind me of that SWAPS//T map thing.\n\nMadeline: why the fuck did they even name it that anyways.
