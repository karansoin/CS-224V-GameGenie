Advance to the lower path of the two in the upper-right corner. Once you reach and activate the large button to clear the towels, advance not to the left as usual, but to the right. Then, travel up into the nearby stream of water to reveal a secret path, leading back to one of the earlier rooms. Then, go upwards and then to the left until you reach the room where you ran into Theo. There is a path at the top of the screen previously blocked by towels; dash up to this path and follow it to find this chapter's Crystal Heart (entitled Scattered and Lost).\n\n## Cassette Tape\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=2) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nThe Cassette room is hidden to the left of the key found in the seventh room of _Elevator Shaft_ through a hole in the wall with light protruding through it.\n\n## Strawberries\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\n### Start\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=4) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\nThere are 11 strawberries in this subchapter (not including the golden strawberry which spawns in the first room).\n\n#### Berry 1\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=5) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=5)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/a/a4/Celestial_Resort_berry_1.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_1.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_1.jpg)\n\nThis strawberry floats low in the air below the second moving dust bunny. Stay bouncing on the spring until the moving dust bunny is at its highest, then move right and grab the wall after grabbing the berry and climb up.\n\n#### Berry 2\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=6) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=6)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/2/2c/Celestial_Resort_berry_2.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_2.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_2.jpg)\n\nIn the third room, this berry is only accessible by exploiting screen transitions. At the end of the room, go back left over the roof and back at the left you can see the strawberry hovering around spikes. Dash diagonally back and forth through this room and the one to the left to reach the platform. Walk off the platform to hit the strawberry then dash left.\n\n#### Berry 3\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=7) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=7)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/b/bb/Celestial_Resort_berry_3.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_3.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_3.jpg)\n\nIn the sixth room, this strawberry is floating near a cluster of dust bunnies. Stand on the fourth floating platform (at the top-left of the dust bunnies) and walk off to the right when the circling dust bunny moves past the bottom-right of Madeline, then dash straight left to land on the green platform.\n\n#### Berry 4\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=8) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=8)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/8/88/Celestial_Resort_berry_4.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_4.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_4.jpg)\n\nA hidden area can be found by walking through the bottom-left of the eighth room (which has the second key). In the room you arrive in, walk into the spring on the floor and grab onto the falling platform. When this platform starts falling, jump and grab the next falling platform, then do it again for the last one. Dash left after this third platform started to fall. This strawberry is in the room to the left. Jump left when the moving dust bunny on the right is moving up, wait a bit, then jump left again and dash directly left without touching the disappearing platform. Then, jump off the wall after claiming the strawberry and you can make it back by jumping and dashing.\n\n#### Berry 5\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=9) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=9)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/e/ef/Celestial_Resort_berry_5.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_5.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_5.jpg)\n\nTo get to this berry, follow the same route as the previous berry. A smashable wall is on the ceiling of the room where the 4th berry is located in, so dash into this ceiling to continue. In the next room, jump and dash straight left to get past the narrow gap with the dust bunnies. Touch the dash crystal and make your way up the corridor, then dash to the left at the top and slide down the left wall, jumping before you land in the dust bunnies, and do the same for the wall you land at. After transitioning from a previous room, complete another room. Dash directly into both dash crystals and wait before dashing the last time underneath the floating dust bunny. After this, go left to find the strawberry on a balcony over a previous room.\n\n#### Berry 6\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=10) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=10)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/9/98/Celestial_Resort_berry_6.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_6.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_6.jpg)\n\nIn the ninth room, a vertical transition is to the top-left of where Mr. Oshiro is waiting. Wait on the last sinking platform to jump to the floating platform furthest to the right, then climb up and jump off the right side and dash diagonally upward to the right to climb the corridor. In this room above, the strategy is just dashing directly into every dash crystal. Slide down the right wall to grab the strawberry and jump off the wall, then dash left to get back to safety.\n\n#### Berry 7\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=11) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=11)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/d/d3/Celestial_Resort_berry_7.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_7.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_7.jpg)\n\nA winged strawberry is at the end of the eleventh room. Climb the first platform and jump over to get to the next one. Jump to the third platform to climb up and jump over it, then stick to the right side of the fourth platform and jump off. From there, grab the berry.\n\n#### Berry 8\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=12) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=12)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/d/da/Celestial_Resort_berry_8.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_8.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_8.jpg)\n\nIn the fourteenth room, this strawberry is floating underneath the leftmost sinking platform. Aim to run off the platform while both circling dust bunnies are far away and grab the wall until you're comfortable dashing out of the pit to climb to safety.\n\n#### Berry 9\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=13) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=13)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/e/e6/Celestial_Resort_berry_9.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_9.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_9.jpg)\n\nIn the fifteenth room, a hidden path is above where you start. Upon entering the room, first walk into the hole and dash to the left to land on the platform. Go right, dash left again, and slide down the wall to then jump off and land on a lower platform. Jump into the gap in-between the dust bunnies and dash left, then you can reach the strawberry. To get out of the area, start climbing the left wall and dash to any nearby disappearing platform to refresh your stamina when needed.\n\n#### Berry 10\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=14) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=14)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/3/37/Celestial_Resort_berry_10.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_10.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_10.jpg)\n\nThis strawberry is floating at the top over spikes. From the start of the room, jump across the first set of dust bunnies and climb the wall you reach. Jump off this wall and dash over the next wall to reach the next platform. Jump to the floating platform and then jump at the top to the other side, then wall jump to the other floating platform. Then, jump to the platform that the berry is hovering over, then jump up and dash to the left. To survive, wall jump off the right side of the very first wall you climbed over and climb up right left side of the wall opposite of it. To continue the room without dying, do a wall jump off the left and dash diagonally up-right to grab the rightmost floating platform, then jump over to move on.\n\n#### Berry 11\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=15) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=15)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/2/29/Celestial_Resort_berry_11.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_11.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_11.jpg)\n\nOn the right side of the fifteenth room, a smashable wall is located on the floor. This will take you to a spot above a previous room with two moving dust bunnies in a narrow corridor. Start running right as soon as the dust bunny on the floor starts moving right, then shortly after jump and dash right to reach the berry. Standing on the elevated floor where the strawberry resided, dash to the left as soon as the moving dust bunny on the floor starts moving right and continue left quickly to get out.\n\n### Huge Mess\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=16) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=16)\\]\n\nThere are 7 strawberries found in this subchapter.\n\n#### Berry 12\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=17) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=17)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/0/0d/Celestial_Resort_berry_12.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_12.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_12.jpg)\n\nThe third room of the green path will have this strawberry hovering near dust bunnies and moving dust bunnies. Walk off the ledge while the dust bunny on the right is also going down, and touch the strawberry. Then, quickly dash diagonally up-right and jump off the right wall to cling onto the floating platform. Do a jump straight up and either walljump off the upper area on the right or climb up it to get to safety.\n\n#### Berry 13\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=18) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=18)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/b/bf/Celestial_Resort_berry_13.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_13.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_13.jpg)\n\nThis berry is located in the fifth room of the green path at the bottom-right. To get it, slide down the wall and dash to the right to grab the floating platform. Climb up and jump over the top of the platform to get the strawberry and then start climbing up the right side of the platform jump over it again and, when your hitbox is inside the dash crystal, dash straight to the left and then dash left again. Finish the room normally to claim the berry.\n\n#### Berry 14\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=19) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=19)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/2/25/Celestial_Resort_berry_14.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_14.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_14.jpg)\n\nThis winged strawberry is protected by dust bunnies in the third room of the purple path. To get to this berry, jump onto each pillar when the dust bunny is moving up and hold onto the sides until the next one does the same (if clutter remains, you can stand on it instead of clinging to the wall). Dash at the end to cause the winged strawberry to fly up, then jump into it to grab it.\n\n#### Berry 15\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=20) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=20)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/9/9c/Celestial_Resort_berry_15.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_15.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_15.jpg)\n\nIn the fifth room of the purple path is a strawberry hiding behind some foreground water. Walk off the right side of the floating platform, dash directly left, and climb up to finish the room.\n\n#### Berry 16\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=21) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=21)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/1/11/Celestial_Resort_berry_16.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_16.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_16.jpg)\n\nA right transition is in the second (third if counting the room shared with the platform-rearranging button's room) room of the brown path. In the room you enter is the strawberry surrounded by trigger spikes. Climb the first pillar of boxes and dash right after jumping from the apex of your climb to land on another set of boxes. Jump and dash from there to the right again, then climb the right wall to collect the berry. When you fall below the set of boxes to the left of the berry, dash directly left to land on the part of the previously stepped-on set of boxes. Jump left to the first set of boxes and dash left over the dust bunnies at the beginning to claim the strawberry.\n\n#### Berry 17\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=22) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=22)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/9/97/Celestial_Resort_berry_17.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_17.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_17.jpg)\n\nIn the fifth room of the brown path, the path to the strawberry is on the left. Walljump up the first section while dodging moving dust bunnies and dash diagonally up-left to avoid touching as many dust bunny-spawning tiles as possible. Wall jump up the second section to grab the strawberry, then dash to the right or up-right when falling back down. Then, safely exit the first section and go through the door.\n\n#### Berry 18\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=23) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=23)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/6/66/Celestial_Resort_berry_18.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_18.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_18.jpg)\n\nAfter pressing any clutter switch, return to the first room. Then, you can go below where the bridge was originally covered and find a room with a strawberry. Avoid the water, as dust bunnies are there.\n\n### Elevator Shaft\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=24) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=24)\\]\n\nThere are 4 strawberries found in this subchapter.\n\n#### Berry 19\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=25) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=25)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/1/13/Celestial_Resort_berry_19.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_19.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_19.jpg)\n\nFirst, try to land at the furthest right possible area on the first platform elevated over the dust bunnies, and don't move. Jump up and dash left without any motion inputs. Next, jump to the left and dash straight up to grab the lower ledge. Jump up from there and land on the right side of the ledge. Then, jump left, dash directly upward, and steer yourself right to land on the right section of the upper ledge. From here, dash right into the berry and land in the lower area where you didn't already stand. Walk to the left, jumping over the dust bunnies you spawned earlier, and, from there, jump left and dash straight up to land on the left side of the lower ledge. Do this again to land on the left side of the upper ledge. Finally, finish the room like normal.\n\n#### Berry 20\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=26) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=26)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/9/95/Celestial_Resort_berry_20.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_20.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_20.jpg)\n\nThis strawberry is in the room below the cutscene with Oshiro. Walk off the platform right as the moving dust bunny at the bottom reaches the right. Dash to the right to land as far on the platform as possible. Jump to the wall and climb up it, then jump off and dash straight up to grab the berry and then hold onto the wall again. Climb up a bit and then, when the moving dust bunny reaches the right, jump to the platform to make it past the dust bunnies you previously spawned. Finish the room like normal to claim the berry.\n\n#### Berry 21\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=27) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=27)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/d/db/Celestial_Resort_berry_21.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_21.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_21.jpg)\n\nAt the start of the long horizontal room containing the key is a gap in the floor. By going down it, a room containing two strawberries can be entered. On the right area, hold onto the wall just under where the moving dust bunnies are going back and forth. When the one in the middle moves to the left, dash directly upward, then move to the right and fall into the gap between two moving dust bunnies. Jump from this wall on the left to the right and collect the dash crystal, then jump back to the left side and climb up the wall. Repeat the first step but mirrored to get to safety and claim this strawberry.\n\n#### Berry 22\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=28) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=28)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/1/11/Celestial_Resort_berry_22.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_22.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_22.jpg)\n\nIn the same room as the previous berry, this one hides behind a cloth on the left. To enter the area, hold onto the left wall and dash up just as the middle dust bunnies move to the right. Then, move left to land on the floor below. Jump and dash up when the moving dust bunny guarding the strawberry is moving away to grab the berry, then fall back down and land on the lower floor without touching the dust bunnies you spawned earlier. Exit the area by repeating the process of entering but mirrored.\n\n### Presidential Suite\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=29) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=29)\\]\n\nThere are 3 strawberries found in this subchapter.\n\n#### Berry 23\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=30) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=30)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/7/71/Celestial_Resort_berry_23.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_23.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_23.jpg)\n\nIn the fifth room, this strawberry requires you to bounce on Oshiro's head to reach it. It's located around a tunnel of dust bunnies and is out of reach without the extra boost. Stand on the right edge of the platform to the left of it and wait until Oshiro's laser shoots out, jump and dash up-right, and fall through the tunnel to get the berry safely.\n\n#### Berry 24\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=31) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=31)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/3/37/Celestial_Resort_berry_24.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_24.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_24.jpg)\n\nA strawberry is near the start in a tight corridor between dust bunnies. Dash up from the floor, jump across, and grab the berry without touching the dust bunnies. Another method is to bounce on Oshiro's head to get on the wall with a dash. From there, dash through where the berry is to get it.\n\n#### Berry 25\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=32) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?action=edit&section=32)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/5/58/Celestial_Resort_berry_25.jpg/800px-Celestial_Resort_berry_25.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celestial_Resort_berry_25.jpg)\n\nAround the middle of the ninth room is a strawberry floating at the bottom. Walk off the left edge, dash to the right, and climb the wall to get it. Be sure that Oshiro won't attack you during this time by letting him pass before you walk off.\n\nRetrieved from \" [https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial\\_Resort/Collectables?oldid=10069](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables?oldid=10069)\"\n\n[Categories](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Special:Categories):\n\n- [Chapters' collectables](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Category:Chapters%27_collectables)\n- [Celestial Resort](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Category:Celestial_Resort)\n\nCookies help us deliver our services.

The subchapter's gimmick is having the player go into 3 different sections of the level which each lead to a [platform-rearranging button](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Objects#Platform-Rearranging_Buttons) that clears the material corresponding to the button from the level. The topmost entrance leads to the platform-rearranging button for green books, the entrance below it leads to the platform-rearranging button for purple towels, and the bottommost entrance leads to the platform-rearranging button for brown boxes. Theo can be seen here trying to enter the vents at the start of the purple path. Alongside platform-rearranging buttons, this subchapter also introduces water. The [Crystal Heart](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_Heart_Guide) of Chapter 3 can be obtained in this subchapter. There is a [Pico-8](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Celeste_Classic) machine found in the other entrance on the right side of the huge room in a secret area, which allows you to play Celeste Classic and unlock it permanently on the main menu.\n\n## **Gameplay**\\[\\]\n\nThe first room of the subchapter has Madeline cross a bridge of the 3 materials to talk to [Mr. Oshiro](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Oshiro) once again, and then the next room is the main hub for the huge mess. Shimmer blocks return for a more noteworthy use as they block the entrances to the 3 main paths until the player goes to talk to Mr. Oshiro, who is stressing out over the clutter. Madeline then volunteers to help clean up and the shimmer blocks all disappear. After finishing an area, the player must talk to Mr. Oshiro again to remove the shimmer blocks again. The shimmer block for an area that has already been completed won't disappear.\n\nThe player is free to go to the 3 paths in any order they wish, however pressing a platform-rearranging button will change the layout of the rooms in the other paths to make some rooms easier and some rooms harder. For an order that minimizes the amount of very hard rooms, take the top (green) path first, then middle (purple), and lastly bottom (brown). This is of course just a recommendation and not the required route.\n\nThe green path has fairly simple rooms when done first. In the second room, jump and dash directly right once the moving sludge is going down and repeat this again for the second one. In the fifth room, if you already removed the purple towels, then moving yourself to right to cling onto the wall and climb up it before jumping to the left is needed.\n\nThe purple path is very safe with all materials intact, but the second room with the brown boxes already removed is made much harder and riskier, so it's best to avoid that. With the brown boxes removed, try to jump and dash right quickly as soon as the moving sludges move up. With the brown boxes, you can ignore the jump and dash right away. In the fifth room on this path, slide down the first wall and then dash right. If you have removed the green books already, then hold onto the wall and jump when the moving sludge moves up and then jump again quickly to climb the wall of purple towels. From here it's recommended to just land on top of the pillars as soon as the moving sludge gets off the floor and get to the bottom when both moving sludges on the left side are moving outward.\n\nFor the second room in the brown path (2 rooms after the room where you can see the platform-rearranging button), your dash timing must be very good. Dash right to go against when the first moving sludge goes left and then quickly jump on the ledge as the next moving sludge goes up. If the purple towels are still there, you can land on them for safety but if not then just dash right when you pass under the box attached to the ceiling. From there climb up and land on the floor above and go quickly through both moving sludges at the bottom, dashing directly downward if needed.\n\nThe Crystal Heart of this chapter can be seen underneath the normal area in the second room of the green path. In order to get the Crystal Heart, you have to find a secret area in the room with the purple towels platform-rearranging button. After hitting this button, there is a secret tunnel found by dashing up where the water is flowing down on the right. Entering this will take you back to previous parts of the section, but with purple towels now gone. Once you make it back to the first room, another secret tunnel must be uncovered which is located in a gap in the ceiling above where Theo's cutscene takes place. This tunnel usually is blocked by purple towels. After entering it, the room after spawns you right next to the Crystal Heart.\n\nThe Pico-8 machine can be unlocked by going to the third exit from the top on the right side of the main huge mess hub room. In this room is a letter to the hotel staff, and to the top-left of it is a secret tunnel which will bring you to the machine.\n\n### **Strawberries**\\[\\]\n\nThere are 7 Strawberries found in this subchapter.\n\nBerry 1\n\nThe third room of the green path will have this Strawberry found hovering near dust bunnies and moving sludges. This berry is deceptively tricky and will take a bit of trial and error. Walk off the ledge at the same time the moving sludge on the right is also going down and touch the Strawberry. Then, quickly dash diagonally up-right and wall jump off the right wall to cling onto the floating platform. Do a jump straight up and either wall jump off the upper area on the right or climb up it to get to safety.\n\nBerry 2\n\nThis berry is located in the fifth room of the green path at the bottom-right. To get it, slide down the wall and dash to the right to grab the floating platform. Climb up and jump over the top of the platform to get the Strawberry and then start climbing up the right side of the platform jump over it again and, when your hitbox is inside the dash crystal, dash straight to the left and then dash left again. Finish the room like normally from here to claim the berry.\n\nBerry 3\n\nThis Winged Strawberry can be found protected by dust bunnies in the third room of the purple path. To get to this berry is just jumping onto each pillar when the moving sludge is moving up and holding onto the sides until the next one does the same (if green books or brown boxes still remain, those can be stood on instead of clinging to the wall). You need to do a dash at the end to cause the Winged Strawberry to fly up, then jump into it to grab it.\n\nBerry 4\n\nIn the fifth room of the purple path is a Strawberry hiding behind some foreground water. This one is simple to get, just walk off the right side of the floating platform, dash directly left, and climb up to finish the room.\n\nBerry 5\n\nA right transition can be found in the second (third if counting the room shared with the platform-rearranging button's room) room of the brown path. In the room you enter is the Strawberry surrounded on all sides with sludge-spawning tiles. What you should do is climb the first pillar of boxes and dash right after jumping from the apex of your climb to land on another set of boxes. Jump and dash from there to the right again, then climb the right wall to collect the berry. When you fall below the set of boxes to the left of the berry, dash directly left to land on the part of the previously stepped on set of boxes. Jump left to the first set of boxes and dash left over the dust bunnies at the beginning to claim the Strawberry.\n\nBerry 6\n\nIn the fifth room of the brown path, the path to the Strawberry can be seen on the left. Wall jump up the first section while dodging moving sludges and dash diagonally up-left to avoid touching as many sludge-spawning tiles as possible. Wall jump up the second section to grab the Strawberry, then dash to the right or up-right when falling back down. Then, safely exit the first section and go through the door.\n\nBerry 7\n\nBy going back to the first room of the subchapter after pressing any of the platform-rearranging buttons, you can go below where the bridge originally covered and find a room with a Strawberry in it. Just make sure not to go in the water, as dust bunnies are there.\n\n##

Each Golden Berry requires the player to finish a chapter without dying in order to be collected. If the player dies, they will be sent back to the room with the Golden Strawberry. This room is usually the first in the chapter, with the exception of [Chapter 6: Reflection](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_6:_Reflection) A-Side, all sides of [Chapter 8: Core](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_8:_Core), and [Chapter 9: Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_9:_Farewell). In these levels, as well as the A and B-sides of [Chapter 7: The Summit](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_7:_The_Summit), starting from these Golden Strawberries will not give the player a clear time, although earning the Strawberry will set the player's lowest-death record to 0.\n\nGolden Strawberries tend to require a lot of practice. The main difference between regular play and attempting to obtain Golden Strawberries is that in regular play, many players will take a trial and error approach. This means that these players may clear harder rooms by luck or by methods that are easily forgettable.\n\nRelying on luck, however, can only take the player so far. This guide aims to provide strategies which help individual screens to be completed faster and, above all, more consistently. Some of these may use advanced movement. General knowledge of the game mechanics and being able to consistently pull off wavedashes and hyperdashes, among other tricks, certainly helps. If you are unfamiliar with advanced movement techniques, it is advised to check out the [Moves](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Moves) page.\n\nIt's good to know the route ahead of time, so a player does not unnecessarily risk going into rooms outside the main path; therefore, a practice run of the longer chapters can help prepare for the task at hand.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1Chapter 1: Forsaken City](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_1:_Forsaken_City)\n - [1.1A-Side (1A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(1A))\n - [1.2B-Side (1B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(1B))\n - [1.3C-Side (1C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(1C))\n- [2Chapter 2: Old Site](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_2:_Old_Site)\n - [2.1A-Side (2A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(2A))\n - [2.2B-Side (2B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(2B))\n - [2.3C-Side (2C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(2C))\n- [3Chapter 3: Celestial Resort](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_3:_Celestial_Resort)\n - [3.1A-Side (3A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(3A))\n - [3.2B-Side (3B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(3B))\n - [3.3C-Side (3C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(3C))\n- [4Chapter 4: Golden Ridge](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_4:_Golden_Ridge)\n - [4.1A-Side (4A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(4A))\n - [4.2B-Side (4B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(4B))\n - [4.3C-Side (4C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(4C))\n- [5Chapter 5: Mirror Temple](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_5:_Mirror_Temple)\n - [5.1A-Side (5A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(5A))\n - [5.2B-Side (5B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(5B))\n - [5.3C-Side (5C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(5C))\n- [6Chapter 6: Reflection](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_6:_Reflection)\n - [6.1A-Side (6A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(6A))\n - [6.2B-Side (6B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(6B))\n - [6.3C-Side (6C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(6C))\n- [7Chapter 7: The Summit](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_7:_The_Summit)\n - [7.1A-Side (7A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(7A))\n - [7.1.1Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Start)\n - [7.1.2500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#500_M)\n - [7.1.31000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#1000_M)\n - [7.1.41500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#1500_M)\n - [7.1.52000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#2000_M)\n - [7.1.62500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#2500_M)\n - [7.1.73000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#3000_M)\n - [7.2B-Side (7B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(7B))\n - [7.3C-Side (7C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(7C))\n- [8Chapter 8: Core](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_8:_Core)\n - [8.1A-Side (8A)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#A-Side_(8A))\n - [8.2B-Side (8B)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#B-Side_(8B))\n - [8.3C-Side (8C)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#C-Side_(8C))\n- [9Chapter 9: Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/celestegame.fandom.com#Chapter_9:_Farewell)\n\n## [Chapter 1: Forsaken City](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_1:_Forsaken_City)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (1A)\\[\\]\n\n1A's very low difficulty makes it very easy to obtain the Golden Strawberry for the level as long as the player is not reckless, as the level is short and without many difficult sections.\n\nCompleting 1A without dashing will allow the player to collect the Winged Golden Strawberry. The Winged Golden Strawberry is unique because unlike other golden berries, the player does not have to worry about dying and it can be obtained before beating 8B.\n\n### B-Side (1B)\\[\\]\n\n1B is a much harder level than 1A. To obtain the Golden Berry, the player must have a decent understanding of how momentum works in this game, often requiring them to grab the traffic light blocks in a specific way to pass an obstacle. In addition, many rooms require the player to manage their stamina properly.\n\nIn the stamina management rooms, it is recommended to learn how to neutral jump, performed by tapping the jump button on a wall with no directional input, as this does not consume stamina. Knowing this trick will help reduce the risk of running out of stamina.\n\n### C-Side (1C)\\[\\]\n\n1C is usually considered the easiest or second easiest C-Side to beat with a Golden Strawberry, as the level's gameplay is relatively straightforward.\n\nIn the first room, dashing upwards into the crystals is the easiest and least risky way to get through the traffic light blocks.\n\nIn the second room, it is recommended to grab the first vertical traffic light block in the middle and the second one in the top or bottom. If the player is comfortable with advanced movement, they can wavedash or extended hyper to the first falling block, grab the second one, and do another wavedash on the final falling block, which allows the vertical traffic light blocks in the middle of the room to be skipped.\n\n## [Chapter 2: Old Site](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_2:_Old_Site)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (2A)\\[\\]\n\n2A is a slightly harder level than 1A, though one minor skip to note does exist and cuts off some of the challenges. The final vertical room of the Badeline chase sequence has multiple quicker strategies. The most notable skip in the final room is a noticeable platform at the beginning that hangs from a wall near some spikes, which leads to a narrow passage that must be dashed through to reach.\n\nMadeline standing at the location which the skip can be done\n\n### B-Side (2B)\\[\\]\n\n2B's Golden Strawberry is generally considered to be either easier or about as difficult as the one in 1B (especially easier if the player is comfortable with space block jumps).\n\nThe majority of difficult rooms involve Badeline chase segments, so it is recommended to find a safe strategy for these rooms. In addition, some rooms can be made easier with space block re-grabs (done by holding grab and the opposite direction in which the player initially dashed).\n\nIn the first room of the final subchapter, there's no need to jump off of the space block as the player can grab the side of it to make moving around easier. It will still be required later in this section though. Once the player goes to the cassette room, they can take their time as it is impossible to die.\n\n### C-Side (2C)\\[\\]\n\n2C's Golden Strawberry is generally tied with 1C's Golden Strawberry in terms of difficulty. The main challenge is mostly about learning the final room, as it is the only one that will likely be challenging for a player. In the last room, there are a few spots in which the player can grab the side of a space block to align themself for a dash. However, most of the space blocks near the end of the room will require space block jumps, so patience is not a possibility. The player should dash directly into the heart immediately after leaving the last space block so that they are not pushed into the spikes by the heart.\n\n## [Chapter 3: Celestial Resort](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_3:_Celestial_Resort)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (3A)\\[\\]\n\n3A's most difficult subchapters are the second, [Huge Mess](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Huge_Mess) and the fourth, [Presidential Suite](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Presidential_Suite).\n\nIn Huge Mess, try to find a room order that suits you the most (example: middle - bottom - top). The less clutter there is in a section, the harder is it to pass them. Try to start with the section you find the most troublesome, and then go with the easier ones. It may be easiest to do the section with the room you find hardest first.\n\nIn [Elevator Shaft](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Elevator_Shaft), the player may attempt to skip the subchapter's key by performing a demodash. However, this is a risky strategy. In the room with the key, the player will want to dash to the sinking platforms when the moving sludges move to the left.\n\nIn Presidential Suite, it's better to take it slow. Rushing and being impatient often results with the player dying in this level. In the part with a row of dash crystals over the dust bunnies, the best strategy is to wait until Oshiro is about to charge at you, and then jump over him and keep dashing. Doing this section like that gives you enough time to take it slow.\n\n### B-Side (3B)\\[\\]\n\nWhile it may look scary at first, 3B is surprisingly very well designed around the cycles. 3B's difficulty mainly derives from its first two subchapters. Many of 3B's screens can be completed in different ways, depending on your timing. It's recommended to keep that in mind to find alternative strategies for certain rooms. Learning how to neutral jump or bounce off of walls without grabbing them helps a lot with managing stamina in many rooms.\n\nApart from the room with key tokens, the [Start (Celestial Resort B-Side)](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Celestial_Resort_B-Side)) is rather straightforward. The best way is to keep it slow and pay attention to the cycles. You can hang on the top corners of the bottom platforms without getting hit by the moving sludge. That way you can wait until the spring is close to you, allowing you to regain your dash and stamina.\n\nThe second subchapter may be the hardest one to learn. In the second room, prepare to jump off of the left walls when the moving sludges are about to move to the right. You can grab the top block as a safe spot. Do the same with the rest of the walls to proceed. The laundry room can be tricky to learn, but it gets very consistent if you get the muscle memory down. In the first laundry room (the one with blue walls), you can wall bounce off of the top right wall to grab the crystal and grab the overhang. It's a good safe spot to land on the purple platform below you. The third laundry section can also be started with a wall bounce to save some stamina. Moving sludges have a longer delay before they move, which is something you have to get used to when practicing.\n\nThe third room is mostly about muscle memory due to awkward timings in some spots. In the second room, you can keep jumping off of the left wall to time your dash between the moving sludges. If done properly, they will move in the middle of your jump, allowing you to dash between them and jumping off of the right wall. This strategy may be a bit risky at first, but it saves a lot of stamina. The second to last section of this subchapter looks very stressful, however it's actually really simple. Jump in between them when they move up, then perform a diagonal downwards dash when they're about to move down. If you understand the timing, this part becomes very simple. The last section can be done by just dashing from spring to spring. Depending on your timing, the cycles may be different, so try to find an alternative strategy just in case if the cycle won't be in your favor.\n\nIn the first Oshiro room, it's recommended to jump on him or climb up when he's about to charge, allowing you to regain your dash and stamina by bouncing off of his head, which can be very helpful at the end of the room. The fourth room can be tricky, however if you perform an extended super at the beginning, you will keep an extra dash while you'll still be collecting the dash crystals, giving you a secondary boost if Oshiro is about to attack you. This allows you to dodge him or the dust bunnies in a very consistent pattern. In the last room, don't waste your dashes, as using them in a wrong spot will most likely end up with dying to the sludge-spawning tiles. The cassette room is pretty straightforward, however try to take it slow to avoid dying on it. The wall on the bottom can be grabbed from different sides and the springs can help you grabbing many Shields at once.\n\n### C-Side (3C)\\[\\]\n\n3C is often considered one of the harder C-Sides for many players. However, most of this level is muscle memory. In the first section, the player needs to jump when the moving sludges are about to move, and then keep dashing diagonally upwards as soon as they grab the dash crystals. It often takes a while to get the rhythm, but once learned, it becomes consistent.\n\nThe third room requires at least one Oshiro bounce at the very end. Use the lightning effect as a visual cue to understand when it's best to jump. He attacks right after the animation ends, so try to jump when it's about to end and you should be able to land on his head easily. Once you get to the gate at the end, you can grab on its side and start moving up when Oshiro is about to charge. It should end with him landing right under Madeline, causing you to bounce off of him. This can be used to regain your dash in an easier way at the very end.\n\n## [Chapter 4: Golden Ridge](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_4:_Golden_Ridge)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (4A)\\[\\]\n\nA good portion of this chapter is just getting used to the wind physics. You can use tricks such as hyperdashes to speed it up, however try to use them only when you're feeling comfortable with it. Triggered platform and guided platform rooms are also worth practicing.\n\nThe snowball section may be tricky for players, as they can easily get hit if careless. Try to take it slow and dash only when you have enough time to move away from the obstacle. If you are close to the right side of the screen, try to wait until the snowball appears and then quickly dash to the right to avoid getting hit by it instantly.\n\n### B-Side (4B)\\[\\]\n\nThe B-Side requires the player to fight with the wind, while performing some tricky jumps, and memorizing patterns for several triggered platform and guided platform rooms that may be difficult. In guided platform rooms, keep in mind that the blocks don't have to fit perfectly into the gaps. If they're less than a block off, they should still fit into the tunnel. Because the rest is rather straightforward to learn, this one mostly relies on getting consistently good at these rooms.\n\nThe first difficult triggered platform room can be found in the middle of the second subchapter, [Stepping Stones](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Stepping_Stones). It's recommended to use as little stamina here as possible. After using the spring, try to jump on the platform so you grab the top of it, then try jumping on the other side without the need to climb back up. There's a significant bit of room for error in this one, but it's recommended to find a strategy without using much stamina. If you happen to start losing stamina while you're about to go to the end, you can quickly climb up and use the platform's momentum when jumping to get enough distance for the last dash crystal.\n\nThe second one can be found in the middle of [Gusty Canyon](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Gusty_Canyon), with three small triggered platforms moving to the right. Activate the first two so that they're very close in line, and then grab the last one as soon as possible and drop on the bottom one when there's enough space. Stay on it and wait until you get to the pillar of crystals. Jump, dash over the crystals and if done properly, you should be able to land on the middle triggered platform. Remember to crouch in order to not hit the ceiling made out of crystals.\n\nAfter that, a guided platform room can be reached, which is not too difficult as long as you remember to keep going quickly. As said before, the platform doesn't need to fit perfectly into the gaps, so try to not spend too much time aligning it and instead hop on the clouds as soon as possible and grab the triggered platform at the very top to get it out of the way. If you don't reach it in time and the guided platform disintegrates, you can also make it back down to the start with some simple maneuvering, which can be very helpful during a Golden Strawberry attempt.\n\nThe ending is a place where people may often die if they mess up the last jump. Wait until the blocks turn to pink, then slowly walk off the very edge of the platform as the blocks change to blue and dash right into the Crystal Heart.\n\n### C-Side (4C)\\[\\]\n\nThe main problem with this section is the second room. The player must be fast, and it's best to save your stamina when needed by not using the grab button while wall jumping. The last room is mostly straightforward but it's recommended to practice the cloud jumps. Try to dash a bit away from the cloud as the wind is pretty strong and you might miss it easily.\n\n## [Chapter 5: Mirror Temple](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_5:_Mirror_Temple)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (5A)\\[\\]\n\nThis chapter is fairly long in a casual run but there are several skips that can make it a lot quicker when doing a Golden Strawberry run. The first one can be found in one of the rooms in the [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Mirror_Temple)) subchapter. When the player stays on the right side of the swap block while it's at the very bottom, they can perform a reversed hyperdash followed by a regular straight dash to skip straight past the corridor of crystals and reach the key room which saves a little bit of time. If you're not comfortable with this technique, it is certainly not a necessity to learn as the time save is not too major.\n\nThe next skip can be found close to the end of the second subchapter, [Depths](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Depths). The player can use the key door skip that's normally required to get the Crystal Heart. Because of that, there's no need to look out for the key which saves some time.\n\nThe last skip, called Search Skip, can be found at the beginning of [Search](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Search). When the player gets to the platforms with keys under them, they can skip most of this subchapter with a specific technique. In order to do it, stay on the left side of the platform to the left and perform a reverse super extended diagonally upwards. It's recommended to practice the timing in order to be capable of performing this trick with replenishing your dash as well. If you don't regain your dash, it means you're doing it too early.\n\nThe rest of the level is pretty much the same, but it's recommended to play through [Rescue](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Rescue) a few times to avoid getting killed by Seekers. If you throw the crystal against a wall and dash upwards into it, you can reach some higher ground if timed properly. If you dash horizontally into the crystal, you gain more momentum for a short amount of time, allowing yourself to escape situations such as being chased by a Seeker. Try to not rely 100% on one strategy and always have a plan B just in case, as Seekers may be a bit unpredictable at times. If you go to a certain spot slightly too quick or too slow, they may move in a completely different place. Keep that in mind to avoid surprise deaths.\n\n### B-Side (5B)\\[\\]\n\nIn the second subchapter, the player can save time by only grabbing one of the keys (the right one is easier but slower, the left one is more difficult but quicker), which allows the player to save time by performing a spike jump (avoiding the key needed for the intended strategy). Although this saves a fair amount of time, it is risky and should be avoided for less experienced players.\n\nIn the final room of the third subchapter, [Through the Mirror](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Through_the_Mirror), a reliable route is to immediately do three supers in a row from the right-hand edge of the initial platform, followed by a brief hesitation before an ordinary jump into the gap. The Seeker will reliably stop within reach. Alternatively, the player can avoid the Seeker entirely by performing an ultra with the final two platforms on the left side, giving enough distance to make it to the rightmost platform. An extended hyperdash from the last platform on the lower right, followed by a dash to grab the side of the platform, also clears the gap. Refer to the subchapter's main page for more specific details on timings.\n\n### C-Side (5C)\\[\\]\n\n5C's Golden Strawberry requires the use of many wall bounces, so it may be in the player's best interest to become comfortable with the mechanic. There's not much to this level except just learning how to time specific dashes or bounces.\n\nIn the first room, the player may opt to perform a wavedash (or extended hyper) on the starting platform to skip the first wall bounce of the room.\n\nIn the second room, a consistent strategy is for the player to align themselves with the center of the swap block's path, which will prevent them from missing the correct timing for the wall bounce.\n\nAt the beginning of the third room, you can use the bottom route to get to the bubbles without much trouble.\n\n## [Chapter 6: Reflection](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_6:_Reflection)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (6A)\\[\\]\n\n6A's Golden Strawberry is located in the second subchapter, [Lake](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Lake). This means that the player can skip the first subchapter, [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Reflection)), and go straight to the second subchapter using the menu.\n\nThe beginning of Chapter 6 is rather straightforward and doesn't require much practice because the player has a lot of room for error to deal with. In the beginning of [Hollows](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Hollows), there's an alternate way to get to the top by doing neutral jumps off of the left wall and then jumping and dashing to the right when at the top of the wall. It's not necessarily faster nor practical, but if a player is comfortable with neutral jumping and afraid of getting crushed by the angry platform, they can use this alternative way.\n\nThe main difficulty of this chapter is the boss fight. Some of the first rooms can be done easily by trying to hit Badeline as soon as possible. In some of the later screens, it's better to take it slow as she can easily catch you off guard. In the feather rooms, try to wait until she shoots the laser and jump and start flying right away. That way you will have enough time to run away from the attack, and if needed, you can dash away from the feather to a safe spot to avoid getting hit. In the long vertical rooms, you can hit Badeline several times by dashing into her from mid-air. It's recommended to hit her as soon as possible in these sections.\n\nThe second phase is generally easier due to it being shorter and giving the player enough time to react. In two sections you have to use a block to momentum jump into her. To perform that, start moving and jump when the block is about to stop, to gain maximum distance. The final room can be easy to mess up, so be sure to learn the timings in it. Similar to the previous rooms, jump into the feather as soon as the laser is gone and fly towards the next safe spot. When you get to the split paths, take the bottom route. It's less risky and it gives you enough time to move away from the beam with this strategy. After that, take your time to perform the next few jumps and pay attention to the laser. Once you get to the cutscene, the berry will be yours.\n\nAs a general tip, don't rush in the laser sections if you aren't confident enough. The indicator moves for a few seconds and then stops for a second, allowing you to jump or grab a block out of its way. Use this to dodge the attacks.\n\n### B-Side (6B)\\[\\]\n\nThough mostly considered fun to complete conventionally, most players quickly realize that this level can be rather frustrating to get the golden strawberry for. It is very difficult to be consistent with quick and precise movements from the feathers, many bumpers which call for specific angling, and a Badeline AI that can change with any slight variations in the player's strategy. It is important to just get a feel for it through practice to minimize the inconsistencies.\n\nIn the sixth room of the [\\|Reflection](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Reflection_(B-Side)) subchapter, the need for the angry platform can be removed entirely with an extended hyperdash, saving the dash that needed to be regained using the aforementioned block. However, this does not save much time.\n\nThe ninth room of the same subchapter requires a lot of precision near the end, it is one of the levels where the strategy is clear but it just requires a lot of practice, though it is important to pay attention to those last two holes. If to the left of the second to last hole, just do a dash; if to the right, then positioning must be corrected towards the left after the dash. That difference makes the last segment feel very inconsistent.\n\nThe second room of the [Rock Bottom](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Rock_Bottom_(B-Side)) subchapter can be made easier by remembering to dash upwards to reach the first falling block and right to reach the second, grabbing onto the left side and jumping over the top at the appropriate time is easier than trying to avoid them entirely.\n\nIn the third room of the subchapter, after the first time Badeline has been touched, the following laser can be dodged by jumping off the falling platform early so she aims it high giving enough time to clear the gauntlet and touch her again before the next laser.\n\nIn the fourth room, it can be tricky near the end of the second use of the second feather, though cutting as much corners in the path as possible can buy time to navigate over the crystals, to the switch and to the third Badeline touch.\n\nIn the fifth room, extended hyperdashing off of the disappearing platform at the end can saving having to use the final bumper which can be tricky with Badeline firing away.\n\nIn the second room of [Reprieve](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Reprieve), after touching Badeline for a second time, the moving wall can be ignored by bouncing on top of the bumper, then dashing into the bumper from the right and dashing up-right over it to Badeline.\n\nIn the fourth room of this subchapter, it is useful to try and bait out Badeline's laser at a safe space before running through each gauntlet whenever possible when entering the room or when grabbing on the side of a wall.\n\nThe last room before the rhythm block room that contains the heart is very hard to complete consistently, fortunately it is the room with the least need for consistency as the relatively easy rhythm block room is the only challenge that lies after it. Retry this room many times until you get comfortable with all of the timing necessary, but remember that the timings on respawns will not be the same as the ones on first entrance which will be what you must follow in your actual Golden Strawberry attempt.\n\n### C-Side (6C)\\[\\]\n\nThe C-Side is rather straightforward, however it's recommended to practice the ending and try to beat it a few times. Some of the bumpers are easy to miss, especially the very last one that can easily lead to a devastating death next to the heart. In some situations it's more safe to dash into a bumper, as hitting it will replenish your dash anyway, and that way you will be more sure that you will not miss it.\n\n## [Chapter 7: The Summit](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_7:_The_Summit)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (7A)\\[\\]\n\nThis is the longest level in the game aside from [Chapter 9: Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_9:_Farewell), meaning that deaths will be very costly especially later on. Knowledge on all of the subchapters will be crucial to ensure that the least time possible is wasted.\n\n#### [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(The_Summit))\\[\\]\n\nThis has rather straightforward platforming and is the easiest part of the level. In the room with a few vertical thin walls, you can skip some of them by dashing under them, making this section a little faster. Apart from that there isn't much difference than the casual run.\n\n#### [500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/500_M)\\[\\]\n\nThis one is also pretty straightforward. As long as you're comfortable with momentum, it shouldn't be too bad. In the section with key tokens, you can grab on the walls and feel free to use springs to replenish your dashes.\n\n#### [1000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/1000_M)\\[\\]\n\nOne of the easiest sections if the player is taking it slowly. If you are rushing it too much, you may risk wasting your dash by accident, not getting enough distance to dash through a space block. Although it's not needed in the game, jumping out of them may make certain actions easier and it can save up a dash for later. In the section with key tokens, a good order is: left, bottom, top, right. After getting the last one to the right, you can use the spring to get your dashes back.\n\n#### [1500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/1500_M)\\[\\]\n\nThis is generally considered to be the second hardest subchapter. Due to the cycles, this one requires some patience to avoid falling into a dust bunny or other obstacle.\n\nIn the section with the four moving sludges and one key token in the middle, use the bottom moving sludge as a visual cue. Stay on the line between the bottom blocks, wait until the moving sludge at the bottom goes to the up-left and then goes back to the bottom-right. Be prepared so right after it goes to the bottom-right, do a diagonal dash to the key token and after a somewhat short delay, perform another diagonal dash. It may be tricky to do at first, but with enough practice it becomes very simple.\n\nThe next section with key tokens is more open. However, if you're careless, you might dash right into a moving sludge. A good strategy is to do a well-spaced diagonal dash followed by a straight dash to the right. If by any means the moving sludge gets in your way, you can dash diagonally, wait for a split second and perform another diagonal dash to the right.\n\nThe last tricky section is at the end. There's some leeway with blocks on which you can stand on if you get a bad pattern or don't want to risk dying. Keep in mind that you can stand on them only once, so either don't walk on the entire platform or dash above/below the moving sludge from the air when going from one direction.\n\n#### [2000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2000_M)\\[\\]\n\nThis is another straightforward checkpoint, however there are two spots that may kill a player. In the first room with wind, there's a spring on the wall that bounces you towards a small floating platform with a spike on top. You have to dash once after getting bounced by the spring and then let yourself get pushed to the left by the wind, however don't do it immediately or you might fly right into the spike. The second tricky section has snowballs that can kill you if you\u2019re careless. Don't mess around too much with tricks and take your time. After it the rest should be rather simple to do.\n\n#### [2500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2500_M)\\[\\]\n\nThis is one of the easiest checkpoints if the player knows how swap blocks and their momentum work. Keep in mind that momentum can be cruel and if you are dashing from a swap block, always jump off of it or you might risk getting pushed off of your destination due to momentum. In the section with the key, you can slide on the left wall and wait until the obstacles move away. It's recommended to keep a dash for the last row of moving blades, as it will save you some struggle.\n\n#### [3000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/3000_M)\\[\\]\n\nThe hardest part of the entire level lies towards the end. Most of it is rather easy to understand and straightforward, however it's recommended to do a few deathless runs of this checkpoints to gain consistency. Pay extra attention to difficult checkpoints such as 16, 14, 13, 11, 10, 9, and 3. They have some timings that are fairly tight for an A-Side and they may easily kill your run if you\u2019re careless. Pay attention to the wind as it also affects your jumps. If the wind blows down, you jump slightly lower, fall faster, and can\u2019t climb as high. If it's blowing up, Madeline is more floaty and jumps slightly higher.\n\n### B-Side (7B)\\[\\]\n\n7B is an extremely long chapter and is considered to be one of the most challenging Golden Strawberries as a result. However, most strategies are straightforward and much of the chapter's difficulty lies in precision. Unfortunately, there is not much to be said other than just practice to help with parts like 3000 M's dreaded checkpoint 13 or while timing bubble exits at 2500 M. Due to its sheer length it is heavily advised to do a lot of practice before ever picking up the golden strawberry, even then it is good to take breaks and go to individual rooms that have caused significant trouble.\n\nThe third room of the 500 M segment is one of the easiest rooms in the game when done correctly, extended hyperdashing off of the first platform will allow the player to just simply dash under then up the block with the first spring on it. Bear in mind the last three blocks with the spikes on top do not need to be grabbed as they too can just be dashed under then up.\n\nIn the third room of 1500 M the cycle can be navigated by leaving as the first moving sludge starts to move from its low position to its high position, from there immediately go to the bottom left switch and onto the spring board right next to it which should launch Madeline to meet the moving platform with a spring in the middle of its path, from there dash up onto the wall to the right of the circling sludge and jump for the top right switch when that moving sludge is just past its closest point to said switch. Go for the spring at the bottom left again which should send Madeline towards the bottom switch, follow that with two dashes upwards in order to land on the spring and head to the bottom right switch. Grab onto the wall and wait to bounce on the spring when it is moving towards Madeline AND the moving sludge is moving away. From there, dash upwards and grab onto the wall next to the final switch, waiting for the nearby moving sludge to move to its low point to jump for the switch and to the end.\n\nThe final room of 1500 M seems very difficult to do consistently. One strategy is to dash into the lower spring as the nearby moving sludge starts moving downwards, dash past the first two moving moving sludges at a steady pace, wait for the third moving sludge to move towards its high position before dashing past and dash past the fourth as it is sitting at its low position. Dash past the fifth moving sludge before it moves downwards in order to hit the spring and pass over it as it is moving down. At the last moving sludge, dash upwards before reaching it and follow with an up-left dash, grabbing onto the wall above the last spring, from there just wait until any appropriate time to drop onto the spring to avoid the moving sludge and dash up towards the end of the segment.\n\nFor the third room of [2000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2000_M_(B-Side)) it is important to note that Madeline can go up to the respawn point without the snowballs appearing. From that point, hyperdash and follow that with a right dash into the left side of the first pillar, climb up it and the first snowball should go under Madeline. Once the pillar has been climbed repeat the process, hyperdash off, dashing into the side and climbing up.\n\nThe strategy for the last room at [2500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2500_M_(B-Side)) is straightforward, however it can be easier to time the exit of the first red bubble by looking at the squid-like eldritch statue in the background and dashing out as the bubble covers its eye.\n\nCheckpoint 17 of [3000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/3000_M_(B-Side)) can be skipped by jumping to the left followed by a up-left dash and an upwards dash in order to super wall jump off of the wall, this will send Madeline high enough and far enough left to be able to grab onto the edge at the base of checkpoint 16.\n\nCheckpoint 4 can be made easier by wavedashing off the edge followed by two upwards dashes. Same can be said for the checkpoint 3, wavedashing left and dashing straight up can skip a dangerous wall bounce. This technique also helps skip to the first cloud of checkpoint 2.\n\n### C-Side (7C)\\[\\]\n\nThe first section of the level is more forgiving that it looks. If you memorize how it looks and if you mess up a wall bounce, you can fall down and grab one of the ledges at the bottom and wait for the dash crystal to reappear. That way you can save yourself from death.\n\nThe last room is muscle memory. The beginning is the hardest part as it requires precise timings. Some springs require to be hit as high as possible to pass through tall walls of crystals. After playing through the room a couple of times and having it fresh in your memory, it should naturally be simpler to complete the room in a Golden Strawberry attempt.\n\n## [Chapter 8: Core](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_8:_Core)\\[\\]\n\n### A-Side (8A)\\[\\]\n\n8A's Golden Strawberry is located in the second subchapter, [Into the Core](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Into_the_Core). This means that the player can skip the first subchapter, [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Core)), and go straight to the second subchapter using the menu.\n\nA good portion of this chapter is memorizing how patterns work. Close to the beginning, there's a major skip known as Ice Skip. In order to perform it, go to the berry room to the left, come back to the room with fire balls on top and keep running, jump into the crystal, dash upwards and then do two diagonal dashes to the top. Keep in mind that the dashes need to be spaced out a bit in order to fit between the flames. Once learned, the strategy becomes very consistent.\n\nAnother room the player may struggle with is the room in [Hot and Cold](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_and_Cold) which has columns of ice balls and bumpers around. Try to find a pattern there and don't rush it. Keep it slow and remember that you can bounce around from one row to another. There's a fair amount of dash crystals that will replenish your dash when needed. At the end of the section, it's best to jump from one row to another and flip the hot/cold switch to progress.\n\nThe last section is not particularly difficult, but it's best to memorize how everything works in them. Because of time pressure, a player may do a lot of mistakes. Despite the time limit, the player still has a decent amount of time to plan their jumps or other actions. In the cassette room, it's best to jump slowly from platform to platform. Keep your dashes for the fire parts and if you don't rush too much, you should be able to complete it fairly easily.\n\n### B-Side (8B)\\[\\]\n\n8B's Golden Strawberry is located in the second subchapter, [Into the Core](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Into_the_Core_(B-Side)). This means that the player can skip the first subchapter, [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Core_B-Side)), and go straight to the second subchapter using the menu.\n\n8B's Golden Strawberry is regarded as the second- or third-most difficult golden in the game. It is very important to develop consistent strategies. Rooms with no or little cycles often show clear strategies and are often down to just skill. This chapter contains many cycles which can be more consistently bypassed with some of the techniques stated below.\n\nThe first room is very chaotic and initially looks daunting to learn. The following pattern will allow all fireballs to be dodged with proper fine tuning of jump height. Wait at the edge and do a short jump as soon as a fireball goes just high enough to jump under, this is to be shortly followed by a up-right dash, jumping immediately as Madeline lands on the next platform and dashing upwards when below the dash crystal, stay still and fall a dash's distance and follow that with a very quick up-right then right dash on to the next platform, follow that with a quick jump off to the right, collecting the dash crystal, dashing up right twice and quickly jumping over the last two platforms.\n\nThe fourth room can be very easily cleared with the correct timing, if the player starts moving as soon as they enter the room (alternatively they can jump off the solid ground the moment they see an ice ball rise from the spikes at the first column), after jumping off the solid ground and dashing up-right they can just jump across the ice balls, just holding left for the first crystal wall, halting at the second and fourth crystal walls in order to fall around half a dash's distance to keep holding right again and halting at the 3rd crystal wall to dash though it.\n\nThe room that marks the start of the [Burning or Freezing](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_or_Freezing) subchapter can be the most difficult to learn due to challenges in grip management. It is advised to touch the launching block when the first fireball touches the bottom wall of crystals (the full cycle involves a full rotation of either of the first two fireballs). Using correct timing to navigate the first two fireballs will allow the final fireball to be accessed by waiting slightly before shooting up the conveyor wall and wall jumping off the protrusion below the fireballs path to the right then off of the left wall.\n\nThe third room of the subchapter can be fairly difficult to learn, though it can be cleared as quickly if the player immediately starts going through it right after entering at walking pace, take as few jumps as possible in order to avoid running out of ice balls to jump on.\n\nThe fifth room of this subchapter has a fairly simple solution to learn, jump onto the first conveyor as a fire ball brushes on top of it, drop just left of the middle of the second ring of fire balls and right dash out of it onto the next conveyor wall and simply jump from the top of it to the next with no delay after jumping off the third conveyor wall up-right dash in the middle of the fifth ring of fire balls to collect the dash crystal, heading right until level with the bottom of the final double-sided conveyor wall, after a very short wait shoot up the conveyor wall onto the other side and then immediately shoot up the right side, making the jump with the last dash.\n\nThe last room of the subchapter is rather difficult. Jump off when a fire ball of the first ring is pointing left and quickly double up-right dash and drop to the first dash crystal, repeat that to get the second dash crystal and then immediately up-right then right dash and drop in to get the third, from there up-right then upwards dash to hit the switch, bounce off of the two ice balls to the left and right of the first ice ring followed by all three from the current left to right of the next. On the next ice ring, jump off of the left ice ball and into the switch followed immediately by and upwards then up-right dash to drop into the next dash crystal with an up-right then right dash, dropping into the second last ring of fire balls, upon hitting the switch there should be an ice ball right under Madeline to bounce off and from there the player can make their way to the end by jumping off the ice balls.\n\nIf you are comfortable with neutral jumping, skipping the fire switch can make the first two rooms of [Heartbeat](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Heartbeat) easier. Ignore the switch and start climbing on the left wall, getting to the frozen platforms. Quickly jump off of them and dash towards the crystal, and after that you should be able to dash to the end of the room. The second room is also more straightforward as there's no need to use the switch on the left side, allowing the player to climb the right wall and start bouncing off of the ice balls.\n\nThe second room of the sub-chapter is mostly straight forward, though one thing of note is that it can be easier to reliably get inside the first ring of fire/ice balls by climbing and jumping off of the right wall.\n\nThe third room of the sub-chapter can seem impossible to learn at first due to its second half, though there is a strategy that one can use to make it easier. wait at the top of the last conveyor wall until a fire ball of the first ring of fire balls points down-right, follow this with two up-right dashes to the dash crystal followed by nothing but upwards dashes, though some minor delays and horizontal adjustments should be made after some of the upwards dashes.\n\nThe last room before the cassette block room can be difficult for people who aren't familiar with launching block momentum. It has a specific pattern that needs to be followed: stay slightly to the right from the middle of the first launching block, then grab the very top of the second block and at the end stay low on the second one, allowing you to use both dashes to get to the edge of the platform. If you miss the timing on the middle block, you can save yourself by either climbing or neutral jumping (the latter is safer though) to the top. It's recommended to practice this room a lot as launching block momentum can be pretty unforgiving.\n\n### C-Side (8C)\\[\\]\n\nThis C-Side is mostly a matter of getting used to the third section. Try to get used to the momentum-based platforms and whenever you have time to wait, use it to max out the time that you will have to go through a part of the section. Hitting switches too early can sometimes end up with certain sections being very hard or impossible to clear. When dashing through the space blocks, if you do a horizontal dash through the second one followed by a space block jump, you can clear the third space block while keeping your dash, which can help make the next bumpers section much more consistent.\n\n## [Chapter 9: Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_9:_Farewell)\\[\\]\n\nFarewell's Golden Strawberry is located in the second subchapter, [Singular](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Singular). This means that the player can skip the first subchapter [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Farewell)) and go straight to the second subchapter using the menu.\n\nThe golden strawberry in Farewell is by far the most difficult one to obtain. Not only are there many extremely difficult rooms that can impede a player's progress, the chapter is also significantly longer than every other chapter in the game. Due to its absurd difficulty, Reddit user DJTom3 is attempting to keep track of everyone who has collected the Farewell Golden Strawberry with verified video proof. As of November 27, 2020, [the list](https://www.reddit.com/user/DJTom3/comments/k1hic9/celeste_farewell_golden_strawberry_collectors_list/) currently has 121 verified entries. [The Farewell Golden Collectors' List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FesTb6qkgMz-dCn7YdioRydToWSQNTg1axFEIHU4FF8/edit?gid=571489394#gid=571489394) is sill being updated every few weeks and count 837 players (15 December 2024).\n\nFarewell has a variety of skips that can be used to make the level take less time, however some of them aren't very viable due to the high risk required to pass them.\n\nOne of the major skips is the [Power Source](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Source) skip. In order to do it, the player needs to have a double dash, a jellyfish and they have to destroy the utility vault. Once it's done, they need to grab the jellyfish with the double dash and go into the hidden top room with the red bubble that leads to a key. The player can skip it by throwing a jellyfish into the tunnel, quickly entering the bubble and updashing into the jellyfish in the right moment to gain enough height to get to the next room. After that they have to perform a rather precise diagonal dash which leads to a hidden room which has fairly simple jumps. This skip can be difficult for some people, but once mastered, it may cut a lot of time for a golden run, especially considering it's fairly early in the level.\n\nIn [Remembered](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Remembered), it is possible to take a jellyfish to the room with tall falling blocks. It can be used to your advantage by updashing and collecting the refills to gain enough height.\n\nIt should be noted that the player sometimes has the option to do extended hyperdashes instead of wavedashes, a tougher technique although it can make some sections easier as they won't be as pressured to jump quickly from one platform to another. This may be especially useful for sections such as the \"comb room\", one of the rooms near the end of [Event Horizon](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Event_Horizon) with triggered platforms. Using an extended hyperdash here usually makes it easier for the player to align themselves to the wall bounce. Generally, watch for the triggered platform to pass the second pillar of crystals to do the wavedash/hyperdash, then for the second triggered platform, watch for it to just reach the first of the pillars of crystals to the right.\n\nIn the tutorial room with two wavedashes followed by a wall bounce, players can stay on the middle block and perform an extended hyperdash instead of a wavedash. If done right, they will grab the very right side of the wall, allowing them to jump to the left and use a wall bounce to get to the top of the platform. This strategy is less risky, because the player doesn't have to deal with momentum from speed tech.\n\nThe tenth room of Event Horizon can sort of skipped by grabbing the very bottom of the triggered platform, allowing you to pass under the crystals above and make the remainder of the room much easier. This strategy allows you to skip the key token in this room.\n\n[Determination](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Determination) is often considered the hardest checkpoint due to a rather tricky rooms the player has to pass through. The first problematic room is the third room, containing a triggered platform with springs on both sides. Make sure to wait for a second when activating the platform, then jumping back right and quickly dashing up towards the crystal and keeping up with the platform. In the area with the double dash crystals, try to slow yourself down and not dash too immediately if needed to not be faster than the triggered platform.\n\nIn the first room with starblades, do a wavedash to the right when the starblades are at the bottom to ensure you can dodge them. In the large vertical room where you must fall past many starblades, do your wavedash or extended hyperdash when they are at the right side and don't be too averse to holding down to accelerate your descent if it would be safer.\n\nThe next hard room is the wind room with springs. With enough practice, it should be rather consistent, however this room needs to be taken very seriously as it's a common choke point. The following room with conveyors can be saved by neutral jumping off of the icy wall in case if you mess up or want to align yourself properly. The last room of Determination is mostly just memorizing how the starblades move, so they don't get in your way when the wind changes. Remember to not play around too much at the end, as being too slow often can result in Madeline being thrown into the starblades at the end of this section. Memorize how the starblades move on the first cycle of the room (aka the one when entering the room as opposed to after a respawn) as this will be what will most consistently occur in a Golden Strawberry run and is thus the most important muscle memory to gather.\n\nThe fourth room of [Stubbornness](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Stubbornness) has some rather tricky timing towards the end. Instead of trying to grab the pink wall, try to dash towards the blue block at the right timing, then jump back to the pink block and again jump towards the blue block to the very right. You have to time it properly so the previous blue block doesn't appear right in front of you.\n\n[Reconciliation](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Reconciliation) is pretty straightforward for most of the time and there aren't many strategies to go speedily that a person can do. However, as this is very near the end of the chapter, it should be taken carefully and slowly whenever possible. In some of the last rooms, there are parts with moving blocks that have different strategies, so try to develop a consistent pattern that suits yourself. In the feather section with a lot of pufferfish scattered around, players can technically skip the feather by either using the fish or wavedashing off of the block at the bottom. [Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Farewell) is pretty much the same as in casual runs and it's recommended to take it slowly as being too hasty may end up with doing mistakes far in the level.\n\nFarewell, unlike other chapters, has a secret room that can only be accessed when the player carries a Golden Berry. It's quite straightforward and it has very few difficult parts, but the player has no opportunity to practice it (unless they're using Debug Mode). There are binoculars that allow the player to check the layout of it, so be sure to look around to see what dangers are around and plan your strategies carefully. You have to be very careful, as failing in this room will take you to the very beginning of the level. If you don't care much about the surprise factor and you want to practice the room, you can use Debug Mode to teleport yourself to the room and mess around with it.\n\nDue to the fact Farewell is very long, it's recommended to do individual runs of each checkpoint to be sure if you're able to complete it without dying. First, try to complete one of each checkpoint without dying, and then try to do two or more of them with as much fails as possible. Consistency is very important for this chapter, and it requires an insane amount of practice and good muscle memory to deal with the length of difficulty of this chapter. Watching someone go for the Golden Strawberry on this level in videos such as [this](https://youtu.be/niuCpSOX_jI) is recommended, as you then see the skips they make, and hopefully, that will help you.\n\nCommunity content is available under [CC-BY-SA](https://www.fandom.com/licensing) unless otherwise noted.\n\nAdvertisement"

This trippy chapter is clearly divided into three subchapters. The joy of exploration opens the chapter up and leads into a chase, while the closing allows time for reflection upon the game\u2019s narrative.\n\nBelow is a list of all 18 strawberries for this level, as well as the locations for the cassette tape and the Crystal Heart.\n\n### Strawberry \\#1\n\nAfter waking up in the dream and dropping into the entry way filled with light, you\u2019ll come to a large, central room to this first portion of the chapter. Enter the room immediately to the left. You\u2019ll enter a room with floating cubes and some have little seeds inside them. We\u2019ll get the seeds later, but for now, smash the floor in the lower left corner to find a hidden room. Drop down and grab the strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#2\n\nSmash the wall in the bottom right of the central room. This path leads to a spiky room. Wall climb and use the green crystals to navigate the spikes safely to the other side. This leads to another room with spikes, but this one hides a succulent strawberry. Hop all the way across to the block on the right-hand side and ride it down as it falls. On the ground, you can dash through the wall to reveal a secret path to a strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#3\n\nAfter the creepy mirror encounter, the dream blocks will activate throughout the entire chapter. Leave the mirror room by traveling upward through the dream block and go to the room on the left. The second dream block in this room houses a secret location. Dash straight up into it to find a hidden room with a strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#4\n\nIn the central room, make your way up to the left corner room. Inside will be a group of floating dream blocks and three of them will contain a seed. You need to use the blocks to dash around the room without touching the ground and gather all three seeds. When you do, a strawberry will form.\n\n### Cassette Tape\n\nOut in the central room, drop to the bottom to find a dream block in the ground. Dash down into it to find the hidden cassette tape room. The blue and pink platforms alternate based off the beat of the music. Time your jumps to navigate the room on the alternating platforms to grab the tape. This unlocks Chapter 2\u2019s B Side level.\n\n### Strawberry \\#5\n\nHead to the top of the central room and use the dream block at the top to go to the right. This room houses a couple of strawberries. You may notice the dream block on the ground has a small hole on the ground beneath it. Climb on top and dash through the floor to find a strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#6\n\nHead to the top of the central room and use the dream block at the top to go to the right. Activate the geared platform and then grab onto the dream block. Dash through when the geared platform is on the other side. Jump off and grab the strawberry and climb to safety.\n\n### Strawberry \\#7\n\nContinuing in the top right room, go further to the right to find the next strawberry. Use the dream blocks to go over the spikes and grab the far right wall. Climb to secure the fruit and then dash your way back over the spikes, this time on the upper pathway.\n\n### Strawberry \\#8\n\nAt the top of the central room is a strawberry beneath the center dream block. Dash down and then immediately up to get the strawberry and to successfully avoid the spikes.\n\n### Crystal Heart\n\nThe trick to this Crystal Heart is to take advantage of the ability to recharge your dash by changing the screen. Go back to the fire at the beginning of the level. You can dash upward into the next screen and zig zag back and forth to grab the wall above. Climb up the next screen.\n\nUsing the same zig zag method go left across the top screen so you can grab the outer wall at the end. Climb up to the top to find the Crystal Heart.\n\n### Strawberry \\#9\n\nLeaving the central room the way you came in, head back out into the snow to find a tall dream block in the center. Dash straight up into it to gain access to a room off to the right. Inside is a small puzzle with dream blocks and spikes. Dash your way to the right wall and the fruit. Then use diagonal dashes to make your way back to safety.\n\n## Intervention\n\nThis set of strawberries are all obtained during the chase with Badeline. You\u2019ll have to stay on your toes as you stay ahead and collect the fruit!\n\n### Strawberry \\#10\n\nOn the second screen of the chase, you will see the strawberry in the upper right corner. Use the tall dream block to get into the corner by dashing diagonally. Grab the strawberry and jump over your doppelg\u00e4nger to avoid being hit. Follow the route of the room to continue the chase.\n\n### Strawberry \\#11\n\nThis strawberry looks like it is in a tricky room, blocked off from you. The secret is to use the dream block to go up and then again to go left into the room with the strawberry. Remember to jump over the doppelg\u00e4nger!\n\n### Strawberry \\#12\n\nAfter the room with the four switches that lower the block that leads to escape is where this strawberry will be. Three apparitions will be chasing you now. Use the spring to climb the wall to reach the higher level. Up above you will see the strawberry. Climb the left wall straight up to it and then hop to the right wall and slide down so your pursuers won\u2019t hit you!\n\n### Strawberry \\#13\n\nIn the room with no floor and two dream blocks is where you will find this strawberry. Dash through the first dream block and grab a hold of the second. Jump upward and dash to grab the spike free wall. Wall jump to the top to find a hidden room with the strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#14\n\nIn the room with no floor and two dream blocks is where you will find this strawberry. After the two dream blocks is a blue block that falls when touched. Do not touch this block! Falling will cause it to obscure the strawberry. Instead, free fall from the second dream block and grab the wall to the left of the strawberry. Then leap off and dash over the spikes to solid ground.\n\n### Strawberry \\#15\n\nThe next room involves a long downward chase. Five doppelg\u00e4ngers will be chasing you. Starting on this screen, make your way to the blue block in the lower right corner. As you ride it down, you can catch a glimpse of the strawberry beneath it.\n\nCross the next room and when you reach the right-hand side climb upward to snag the strawberry you saw coming down.\n\n### Strawberry \\#16\n\nWith the chase over, you\u2019ll enter a stretch with dream block columns. The fourth column is the key to this strawberry. Dive down into the dream block from the top to find a hidden room. Use the dream blocks in the middle to cross the room to the strawberry. Dive diagonally through them from the bottom. Use the same method to cross back to the other side.\n\n### Strawberry \\#17\n\nWith the chase over, you\u2019ll enter a stretch with dream block columns. The fourth column is the key to this strawberry. Jump from the top of the column to find a room above. Dash up through the dream block here and collect the strawberry at the top. Use the dream block to go back and forth as you fall to avoid spikes.\n\n## Awake\n\n### Strawberry \\#18\n\nOnce awake from the dream, you can walk the same path you did in the dream, but without the rad dream blocks. Talk to Theo up top, if you\u2019d like. The room that had all the dream block columns now has springs. Above the fifth spring is a gap in the ceiling. Use the small platform near the spring to jump up and dash into. At the top is a room with a flying strawberry. Starting with the spring on the left, use the platforms and springs to get to the strawberry. You\u2019ll need to dash into it. Make sure you are close enough or it will fly away.\n\n### Up Next: Chapter 3- Celestial Resort\n\n[Previous\\\n\\\nChapter 1- Forsaken City](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Chapter_1-_Forsaken_City) [Next\\\n\\\nChapter 3- Celestial Resort](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Chapter_3-_Celestial_Resort)\n\n### Top Guide Sections\n\n- [Walkthrough](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Walkthrough)\n- [Tips and Tricks](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Tips_and_Tricks)\n- [Strawberries](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Strawberries)\n- [Cassette Tapes](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Cassette_Tapes)\n\n### Was this guide helpful?\n\nLeave feedback\n\n### In This Guide\n\n[Celeste](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\n[Matt Makes Games Inc.](https://www.ign.com/games/producer/matt-makes-games-inc) Jan 25, 2018\n\n+2\n\n[Learn more](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\nGo to comments"

With its strong winds that push you around, bouncy clouds, moving blocks, and popping bubbles it will demand your accuracy. Fear not! It is possible and quite rewarding when completed. And when you collect every last secret, victory tastes so much sweeter.\n\nBelow is a list of all 29 strawberries for this level, as well as the locations for the cassette tape and the Crystal Heart.\n\n## Start\n\n### Strawberry \\#1\n\nAfter learning the two new mechanics for this chapter--the clouds and the bubbles\u2014you\u2019ll come to a calmer area marked by the old lady and her crow. Dash into the small cove to the left of the waterfall and walk through the wall to find the strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#2\n\nOn the screen after talking with the old lady, you can spot the strawberry near the bottom. Use the wind to press you against the wall with the strawberry. Climb up and dash to the column in the middle. Hop to the other side and then jump to the ledge for safety.\n\n### Strawberry \\#3\n\nUsing the bubbles to break through the walls, you can spot the strawberry near the top between columns of spikes. Use the bubble beneath to dash up and grab the fruit. The bubble will return for you to continue dashing through the walls.\n\n### Strawberry \\#4\n\nOn the screen that intorduces the disappearing pink clouds you will see htis strawberry on the right side. Use the final cloud\u2019s lift and a dash the nab it and then climb up to safety.\n\n### Strawberry \\#5\n\nSimilar to Strawberry #2, you\u2019ll want to use the wind to collect this strawberry. Drop down to the wall adjacent to the strawberry. Use your dash to fight the rightward wind to get the strawberry. Use that wind to safely jump back to the other wall. Climb out and drop to the ground to secure the fruit.\n\n### Strawberry \\#6\n\nAfter activating the switches to open the path, smash the suspicious looking block in the left corner to find this strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#7\n\nOn the screen that has three clouds over a large hole with a leftward wind, use the second cloud to jump up and to the left. Dash to make it to the left corner where a secret path can be found.\n\nThere are four strawberry seeds on the screen. You must collect them all without your feet touching the ground to create a strawberry. Whenever you grab one seed, a leftward wind will immediately start blowing. You need to use this wind to navigate the room without touching the floor.\n\nStarting on the right, climb the wall to grab the first seed. Use the wind to leap to the first column and then hop over to the spring on the other side. This spring recharges your stamina and dash. Fighting the wind, jump straight up and dash to grab the wall next to the second seed. Jump off and back down to the spring to recharge with two seeds in tow.\n\nGrab onto the second column and hop over to its left side. Slide down and drop to the third seed, dashing up and to the left once you grab it. The wind will carry you to the third column. Your stamina will start to run low.\n\nHop of the third column and then to the left wall. Now wall jump up to the final seed to create the strawberry.\n\n### Cassette Tape\n\nOn the screen that has three clouds over a large hole with a leftward wind, use the second cloud to jump up and to the left. Dash to make it to the left corner where a secret path can be found. Walk to the left on the screen with the seeds.\n\nThis is the cassette room. The blue and pink platforms alternate based off the beat of the music. Time your jumps to navigate the room on the alternating platforms to grab the tape. This unlocks Chapter 4\u2019s B Side level.\n\n### Strawberry \\#8\n\nUse the rightward wind to wall jump up the right-hand wall without using stamina. When the wind stops jump to the column near the strawberry, using your dash. Hop over the top and grab the strawberry. The wind will kick back up and blow you back to the right side where it is safe to land.\n\n## Shrine\n\nThis area of the chapter features one off rooms that contain plenty of secrets and strawberries. Once you complete a room, it closes off to you from further access.\n\n### Strawberry \\#9 & 10\n\nAt the start of the shrine area, head into the open path to the right. You\u2019ll find a moving block that you\u2019ll have to navigate through gaps to reach the strawberries on the right. That\u2019s correct\u2014two strawberries!\n\nThe first is out in the open. Ride the block making sure it goes beneath the spike platforms. After jumping the second spike platform, press the block down so it can reach the far right wall. Jump and dash to grab Strawberry #9. Land on the platform again to regain your dash and grab the far right wall.\n\nDash through the block above to find Strawberry #10. Jump onto the left facing block and ride it back to secure both strawberries.\n\n### Strawberry \\#11\n\nBack in the main area of the shrine, climb and dash up the left wall and enter the hallway. You can see the strawberry beneath the bridge. You\u2019ll need to ride the moving block below to be able to grab the fruit.\n\nRide on the right-hand side of the block. Jump up to snag the strawberry and then dash back to the block to ride it to the other side.\n\n### Strawberry \\#12\n\nReturn to the main area of the shrine and use the moving block to go straight up. Inside this area you will find this strawberry. Use the moving blocks to cross the room and nab the fruit. Use the left facing block in the upper right corner to return back to the beginning.\n\n### Strawberry \\#13\n\nContinuing upward through the main shrine area, enter the second entrance on the left side. This strawberry requires navigating a few rooms to get to it. Using the moving block to go left, thread it through the small gap in the platforms. Hop over the obstacles and land back on your moving block, pushing it down so you may reach the other side. Jump up and dash to the platform above.\n\nIn the next room you must use the upward moving block to reach bubbles at the top of the screen. Use the bubbles to make it to the top left corner and then navigate your way down the left side of the screen.\n\nOn the final screen, use the bubble to move diagonally toward the moving block. Use your dash to grab on and move it to the right. When it brteaks on the ceiling, drop down and to the right to land next to the strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#14\n\nHead to the area at the top of the shrine area screen. You\u2019ll end up next to an outhouse. Use the pink cloud to hop onto the top of the moving block. Weave it up and down to reach the oppostie wall. Drop down to the next screen and walk over to get the strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#15\n\nGrab onto the moving block in the main area of the shrine and weave it to the left around the main obstacle. Go back to the right to reach the glowing area.\n\nHop into the water and swim to the right to find a hidden area with a strawberry. Smash the right wall to find more secrets!\n\n### Strawberry \\#16\n\nGrab onto the moving block in the main area of the shrine and weave it to the left around the main obstacle. Go back to the right to reach the glowing area. Hop into the water and swim to the right to find a hidden area. Smash the right wall to find a room with a Super Mario Bros. 3-esque block. Pass the block for now and smash the right wall in this room.\n\nThe strawberry will be on the path above you. Use the moving blocks to move around the room to get the fruit. Jump onto the rightward moving block. Make sure to land on the upward block to move it out of the right block\u2019s way.\n\nJump and dash up to the leftward block. Ride on this block and jump over any spikes in your way. Dash to the strawberry to collect it.\n\n### Crystal Heart\n\nGrab onto the moving block in the main area of the shrine and weave it to the left around the main obstacle. Go back to the right to reach the glowing area. Hop into the water and swim to the right to find a hidden area. Smash the right wall to find a room with a Super Mario Bros. 3-esque block.\n\nThis is more than a visual homage to the classic platformer. Just like in SMB3, hold down on the white block until you drop into the background. Using the light pink rocks that made up the background, climb up to the top area of the screen to find the Crystal Heart. Dash into it to collect it.\n\n### Strawberry \\#17\n\nDuring the final stretch of the shrine subchapter is where you will find this strawberry. You\u2019ll use a cloud to reach a moving block. You need to weave the block through the obstacles to reach the end. On the path, you will seee the strawberry in a small area above.\n\nOn the small stretch of ground before the strawberry, drop down from the platform and grab onto its left side. Jump up and dash through the strawberry and land back on the block to ride it to the right side of the screen.\n\n## Old Trail\n\n### Strawberry \\#18\n\nRight at the start of the old trail, use the wind to wall jump up the left wall. At the top is an entry point to a room with a flying strawberry. Use the wind to land on the left wall. Climb up to the height of the strawberry and then dash into it. As you fall, hold grab so that you can grab the right wall and climb to safety.\n\n### Strawberry \\#19\n\nYou can spot this strawberry at the bottom of the screen near the beginning of the Old Trail. Fighting the wind, jump and dash up the the small \"L\" shaped platform up above. Now jump and dash into the bubble. Using the bubble, go to the left to land on the strawberry. Diagonally dash up to grab the column wall and climb to safety.\n\n### Strawberry \\#20\n\nYou can see this strawberry as you ride on a moving block with spikes on the left side. It\u2019ll be at the end of the ride with a bubble leading to safety. While riding the block, you need to use the bubble to replenish your dash. Jump into the bubble and exit to the right, making sure to grab back onto the moving block.\n\nRide the block all the way to the right and climb up to collect the strawberry. Drop down and use the wind combined with your dash to get back to the bubble and use it to get to safety.\n\n### Strawberry \\#21\n\nAfter using four moving blocks to navigate a room full of spikes, you\u2019ll see an entry way to the left. It leads to a strawberry room that revolves around wind. A strong leftward wind will be blowing. Use it and a dash to reach the strawberry.\n\nClimb up to the green crystal. Using the crystal, dash diagonally to the second green crystal to refresh your dash. Use this refresh to dash right into the small block.\n\nWait for the second crystal to regenerate. Once it does, jump and dash into the bubble. Exit the bubble to the right and dash immediately to make it to the small column. Make a small up to regenerate your dash. Slide down the column and dash immediately to the right to ensure you land on solid ground.\n\n### Strawberry \\#22\n\nContinuing up through the room with four moving blocks to navigate through the spikes, you\u2019ll spot this strawberry. It is in a precarious position above spikes with a switch block. Ride the moving block to the right and leap off before it gets to the wall, making sure to stop at the switch. Wait for the switch block to move all the way over. Using the switch itself as a marker, jump off and dash over the spikes to snag the fruit and grab onto the switch block. Quickly climb out and fall to safety before your stamina depletes.\n\n### Strawberry \\#23\n\nThis strawberry is in the room with springs at the beginning. You\u2019ll use the springs to reach bubbles and this is where you can spot your target. The strawberry is floating above spikes. You need to time your use of the bubbles to launch at the strawberry and then combining your dash with the wind safely grab onto the wall. Climb into the bubble and launch yourself back down toward the springs to go get Strawberry #24. If you only want/need this strawberry, continue up the screen.\n\n### Strawberry \\#24\n\nThis strawberry is in the room with springs at the beginning. You\u2019ll use the springs and wind to launch into the cracked wall on the right. This hidden room is filled with bubbles that you\u2019ll need to use to reach the top. Dash and climb your way up. You can see the strawberry beneath the final bubble. Launch down to the strawberry from the final bubble and grab onto one of the walls to wait for the bubble to return. Then use it to escape the room by going up.\n\n## Cliff Face\n\n### Strawberry \\#25\n\nAt the start of the Cliff Face sub-chapter you can see a small crack on the ceiling. Using the cracked rock you can climb up and dash into the hole in the ceiling. Don\u2019t worry if ypu smashed the block. You can still jump and dash your way up there, it\u2019s just a tad trickier.\n\nThe trick to this strawberry room is to be on the far side of a couple of the moving blocks so that you may reach the far off platforms. Hop onto the left side of the first moving block and move it to the left. When it reaches the top, leap off and dash into the bubble. Exit the bubble to the left and immediately dash upward to avoid the spikes. Grab the wall and hop onto the next moving block.\n\nNavigate the block through the hole and then back to the right, moving it to be close to the next block. Jump over to the third block\u2019s right side and execute the same technique as before. At the top jump into the bubble below.\n\nUse the bubble to grab onto the final moving block and ride it halfway up, being mindful of the spikes waiting at the very top. Drop down and dash horizontally through the gap in the spikes to snag the strawberry and land safely.\n\n### Strawberry \\#26\n\nThis strawberry is easy to spot. It can be found floating beneath four disappearing platforms. Fight the wind by jumping and dashing to reach each platform. On the final one, jump back to nab the fruit and then dash upward to ride the wind back to a previous platform.\n\n### Strawberry \\#27\n\nWhen giant snowballs start targeting you, then you\u2019ll know you are near this strawberry. Fight the wind and dodge the snowballs as you cross the screen until you spot the fruit near the top. Make your way to the nearby bubble and launch up to float back toward the strawberry. Land on a platform to secure it.\n\n### Strawberry \\#28\n\nThis strawberry can be found above the second bubble on the screen after the snowballs. Simply dash up from the second bubble to get the fruit and wait for the bubble to regenerate.\n\n### Strawberry \\#29\n\nThis strawberry is on the final screen of the chapter. You\u2019ll know you are there when you use a strong rightward wind to leap to bubbles. After passing the spiked column you can see the fruit beneath a bubble and spikes.\n\nUse the closer bubble to launch toward the strawberry. Once you touch it, dash immediately upward to land in the second bubble. From here, exit straight up and ride the wind with one diagonal dash to safely grab the fall and climb to safety.\n\n### Up Next: Chapter 5- Mirror Temple\n\n[Previous\\\n\\\nChapter 3- Celestial Resort](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Chapter_3-_Celestial_Resort) [Next\\\n\\\nChapter 5- Mirror Temple](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Chapter_5-_Mirror_Temple)\n\n### Top Guide Sections\n\n- [Walkthrough](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Walkthrough)\n- [Tips and Tricks](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Tips_and_Tricks)\n- [Strawberries](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Strawberries)\n- [Cassette Tapes](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Cassette_Tapes)\n\n### Was this guide helpful?\n\nLeave feedback\n\n### In This Guide\n\n[Celeste](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\n[Matt Makes Games Inc.](https://www.ign.com/games/producer/matt-makes-games-inc) Jan 25, 2018\n\n+2\n\n[Learn more](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\nGo to comments"

They unlock each chapter's respective [B-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides#B-Sides). As such, collecting them is required to unlock a chapter's red crystal heart, and all of them must be collected before the C-Sides are unlocked. Cassette Tapes are always in a Cassette Room, featuring [Cassette Blocks](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Block) and an 8-bit remix of the chapter's music. Collecting a Cassette Tape will always lead to Madeline being transported, via bubble, back to the beginning of the room she came from (in [8A](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Core#A-Side) she gets bubbled to the end instead).\n\nAt the level select screen, you can see the checkpoint where the cassette tape (along with strawberries) is found, which can help you locate it.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1Locations of Cassette Tapes](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Locations_of_Cassette_Tapes)\n - [1.1Forsaken City](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Forsaken_City)\n - [1.2Old Site](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Old_Site)\n - [1.3Celestial Resort](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Celestial_Resort)\n - [1.4Golden Ridge](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Golden_Ridge)\n - [1.5Mirror Temple](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Mirror_Temple)\n - [1.6Reflection](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Reflection)\n - [1.7The Summit](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#The_Summit)\n - [1.8Core](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Core)\n- [2Trivia](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Trivia)\n\n## Locations of Cassette Tapes\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=1) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\n**Thou hast been warned!**\n\nThis section contains spoilers for Celeste. Do not read the following section if you wish to avoid spoilers for Celeste.\n\n### [Forsaken City](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=2) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nThe cassette is hidden at the beginning of the Chasm checkpoint. To find it, go past the zipper on the left to reach an optional area, and then stand on the next zipper and launch yourself upwards. It will take you to a berry room. In the wall to the left is the hole, covered by another zip mover. Grab it to get it out of the way, and the cassette room can be found past the gap in the wall.\n\n### [Old Site](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\nIt's found in the Start checkpoint. Go down-right to activate the dream blocks, and after coming back to the \"hub\" section, fall to the very bottom and dash through the dream block in the ground.\n\n### [Celestial Resort](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=4) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\nThe cassette can be found in Elevator Shaft. Get to the key room and the entrance will be visible on the very far left. It's indicated by a light beam coming out of the hole.\n\n### [Golden Ridge](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Ridge)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=5) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=5)\\]\n\nThe cassette is fairly early in the Start checkpoint. After passing through the touch switch room, the next room has a hidden entrance that can be seen in the top-left corner. Use the second white cloud to reach this height, and run to the left of the berry room which takes you to another hidden area with the tape.\n\n### [Mirror Temple](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Mirror_Temple)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=6) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=6)\\]\n\nThis cassette is found in the Depths checkpoint and can be easily missed if you aren't exploring the entire map. After going past two rooms to the right of where you first encounter [Theo](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Theo) in the mirror, fall off the metal platform and take a red booster to the right.

Do not read the following section if you wish to avoid spoilers for Chapter 3: Celestial Resort.\n\nMadeline finds a decrepit hotel, then bypasses animated globs of slime to gain access to the hotel's front door. Upon entering the hotel, Madeline finds an old and damaged guestbook with ominous glowing comments. Madeline then rings the bell at the front desk, summoning a ghostly figure. Madeline is shocked by the presence of a ghost, but he assures her that there's nothing wrong, presenting himself as Mr. Oshiro, the Celestial Resort Hotel's concierge. He assumes that Madeline will stay at the hotel, but Madeline insists that she's just passing through; Mr. Oshiro, refusing to believe that Madeline is leaving, begins escorting Madeline to the hotel's presidential suite, hoping that it will convince her to stay at the hotel.\n\nAs Madeline follows Mr. Oshiro through the hotel, Mr. Oshiro becomes increasingly flustered by Madeline's comments on the poor state of the hotel, eventually leading him to lose hope due to the hotel's large amount of clutter. Madeline decides to stay behind to help Mr. Oshiro clean up the hotel. In the process of doing so, Madeline encounters Theo, who distrusts Mr. Oshiro and wants for Madeline and himself to leave through a nearby air vent; Madeline refuses Theo's offer, thinking that she can get through to Mr. Oshiro and help him, so Theo leaves by himself.\n\nEventually, Madeline manages to clean up the hotel, although she becomes annoyed by Mr. Oshiro's attempts to make her feel like the hotel's service level is high enough that her efforts are unnecessary. Mr. Oshiro then takes Madeline to the hotel's presidential suite in a desperate attempt to keep her as a guest, but the two become separated when Mr. Oshiro has a breakdown in front of the suite's entryway and inadvertently clogs up the passage between Madeline and himself with globs of slime, forcing Madeline to take an alternative route to catch up with Mr. Oshiro. On this alternative route, Madeline encounters Mr. Oshiro's decades-old diary, the final entry of which details Mr. Oshiro's refusal to part with the hotel when it closed at around the time that the diary dated to.\n\nMadeline finally arrives at the presidential suite. There, Mr. Oshiro worriedly tries to win her over with the suite's amenities; Madeline indicates somewhat facetiously that she likes the suite, but can't stay despite the suite's niceness. Mr. Oshiro argues with Madeline, trying to keep her there, until [Badeline](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Badeline) appears in the presidential suite's mirror, breaks out of the mirror, and severely reprimands Mr. Oshiro for trying to make Madeline stay there when the hotel was low-quality. Madeline tries to console Mr. Oshiro, but he becomes angry and tells her and Badeline to leave, which they do (made possible by Badeline breaking a hole in the ceiling).\n\nOutside, Badeline smugly compliments herself for having rescued Madeline. Annoyed, Madeline tries to make Badeline leave, resulting in Badeline mocking her for abandoning her goal of climbing the mountain to help Mr. Oshiro. Mr. Oshiro arrives and glumly asks Madeline to tell him why she would help him and then ditch him, leading Badeline to tell Mr. Oshiro that Madeline was only helping Mr. Oshiro out of a selfish desire to feed her ego. As Madeline tries to dispel this explanation, Badeline disappears, leaving Madeline to deal with a now enraged Mr. Oshiro, who proceeds to chase Madeline across the hotel's roof.\n\nAt the rooftop's edge, despite Madeline's frightened pleadings, Mr. Oshiro destroys the awning that he and Madeline are now perched on, sending the two down to the hotel's back exit on ground level. Mr. Oshiro, now back to normal, decides sadly to close the hotel for repairs. He then leaves, asking Madeline to leave him alone; after slight hesitation, Madeline does this, continuing on her journey.\n\n**Show/Hide Content**\n\n## **Quotes**\\[\\]\n\n**I tried to warn you.**\n\nThis section contains spoilers for Chapter 3: Celestial Resort.

This uses a pixel-perfect demodash to clip through a wall of dust bunnies, saving about 12 seconds. This works because the demodash reduces the vertical extent of Madeline's hitbox such that it becomes possible to fit between the hitboxes of the individual blob spike objects. This is possible with most blob spikes in the game, but because it is pixel-perfect and nowhere else does it save anywhere near as much time, shaftskip is the only instance of this trick being viable in full game runs. It has been used in the tape room of 3B, however, and is conjectured to be viable in a few other levels (mostly C-sides) as well but has not been successfully applied in those.\n\n##

The subchapter returns the player to the entrance of [Mr. Oshiro's](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Oshiro) resort and has them enter in. There's a small secret found in this subchapter to get a glimpse at some birds using skull binoculars.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1**Gameplay**](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Celestial_Resort_B-Side)#Gameplay)\n - [1.1**Strategies**](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Celestial_Resort_B-Side)#Strategies)\n - [1.2**Secret Bird Room**](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Celestial_Resort_B-Side)#Secret_Bird_Room)\n- [2**Gallery**](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Celestial_Resort_B-Side)#Gallery)\n\n## **Gameplay**\\[\\]\n\nThough in the first two rooms there aren't any sludge-related enemies to be seen, in the third room the player enters into the hotel and from there tons of these sludges will be in the rest of the rooms. The third room of the subchapter will focus on circling sludges, while the rest of the following rooms will use many moving sludges all across.\n\n### **Strategies**\\[\\]\n\nRoom 1\n\nThis room will just have you jump over the gap and dash straight to the right, grabbing the ledge if needed, and reaching the end.\n\nRoom 2\n\nIn this room, you'll need to do a lot of wrap-around wall jump to descend while dodging spikes. Jump on the spring and do a diagonal up-right dash to the right side of the top floating platform. Wall jump to the right, then start moving back left as you approach the next one and repeat until reaching the dash crystal. It's entirely possible to also just go underneath the first two floating platforms and dash into the third one, saving a bit of time. After touching the dash crystal, dash diagonally up-right and you can either wall jump to the left and then back right or just climb up this floating platform and jump over it to the right. From there just get over the last floating platform and wall jump off, then you're at the door to the hotel.\n\nRoom 3\n\nThere are very many circling sludges in this room and stamina will be tight here. Jump to the first platform when it's safe, then wait until you can jump and dash diagonally up-right to grab the platform up above, then climb on top of it. After the circling sludge around you passes, jump right and dash straight right to climb the platform you reach, then jump over the sludge on top of it and grab its right side when it's safe to do so. When the coast is clear, jump to the next floating platform and again climb it and jump over the sludge on top, then jump to the next floating platform where it's safe to stand. In this next section, you'll want to be quick. Jump and dash up-right to climb the floating platform above and jump to the right side of it when you can. Grab on and wait until you can jump to the next nearby platform, where you should do the same thing. Then, before you run out of stamina, jump to the last platform, which will fall if you wait too long so just get off it quick and you've finished the room.\n\nRoom 4\n\nWatch the first two moving sludges until they're both at their highest, and when they are you should jump to the wall and do a wall jump off, then swiftly do another off the left wall to go all the way right and reach the bottom of the right side of the floating platform. Quickly jump off to the right and dash straight up, then jump to the right side and grab the wall while collecting the dash crystal. Watching to your right now, wait until the nearby two moving sludges reach their lowest point to fall down and dash diagonally up-right and grab the platform. When the moving sludge on the left goes back up, jump to its wall, then wall jump back to the right and weave inbetween the other two moving sludges to then wall jump off the floating platform and reach the end of the room.\n\nRoom 5\n\nWalk into the spring and dash up-right and fall to the dash crystal. When you reach the dash crystal, dash in any direction that will prevent you from hitting a moving sludge and hold onto the wall. Do wall jumps back and forth until the dash crystal comes back, then time your wall jumps to get over a moving sludge as it goes down to allow yourself to climb up and dash up-right over the pile of sludge above. Do your dash when the moving sludges in the right corridor are both at the edges. Then, climb up the right wall to move past the moving sludge right as it goes left and then jump up and dash to the right. Do your dash when the moving sludge at the right of your position starts to move left and hold right as much as possible. Then, as you fall, hold left to dodge the other moving sludge and you'll be safe.\n\nRoom 6\n\nIn this room, cycles are very inconsistent, so for the safest way to line yourself up you should bounce off the first spring and then dash diagonally up-right to grab the wall. From here, wait until the moving platform reaches the left and the moving sludge is not going left to fall onto the moving platform and bounce on the spring. For the bottom key token, find a time to fall in the middle when both the moving platform and moving sludge won't be there, then dash straight to the left or right and hold the wall until you can jump up to the moving platform safely. For the key token above you, stall constantly by doing a straight upward dash and landing back on the spring until you find a moment to dash up above a moving sludge and wall jump to the key token, then fall and land on the moving spring again. After these two key tokens have been collected, get the third and last one at the top right by bouncing up with the spring to then climb up the left side. When you can, jump to the right and dash straight right into the key token and grab the wall. When the moving sludge goes down, jump over it and then fall back to the right to reach the end of the room.\n\n### **Secret Bird Room**\\[\\]\n\nBy going to the left of the first room of the subchapter, a secret room is reached. This room seems pretty barren, having only a platform far to the left with spikes on top of it. By doing a wavedash to the left, you can get to this platform and use your dash to get across the spikes. Another platform left of the spiked one can be reached which just has skull binoculars on it. By viewing it and holding left for a few seconds, you'll eventually come across a platform with some birds on it at the far-left side of the room. Getting back from this area is barely possible with a wavedash at the right edge and a diagonal up-right dash to just be able to reach the ledge you started at and climb up it. Notably, if you go to this room and die, the Golden Strawberry will no longer spawn in the first room of the subchapter unless you restart the chapter. This doesn't happen if you bring the Golden Strawberry into this room, though.\n\n##

Obtaining a chapter's Cassette is required in order to unlock the chapter's B-side level, which uses the mechanics of its respective chapter but is significantly harder. Cassettes are always obtainable in their own room after a gauntlet of [Rhythm Blocks](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Rhythm_Blocks).

Just after finishing the room that requires the player to collect two [Shields](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Shields) in order to move a [Shield-Activated Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Shield-Activated_Platforms), the player must bounce on the second [White Cloud](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/White_Clouds) from the left, then dash up and left in order to access the top-left corner of the room. The player must then go as far left as possible, passing through the following room (which should contain a number of [Springs](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Springs) and strawberry fragments in order to find this Cassette's room.\n\n## Chapter 5: Mirror Temple\\[\\]\n\nThis Cassette can be found in this chapter's second sub-chapter, \"Depths\".

Taking this orb to the right will lead to a platforming segment; completing this segment and pressing the [Dash Switch](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Dash_Switches) there will open another Temple Gate to the bottom right of this room. Clearing this second room by depressing its Dash Switch will open yet another Temple Gate at the bottom right of this following room, leading to a third, more illuminated room. At the bottom right of this third room, the player can simply walk through a section of cracked wall (with or without completing any associated challenges) to access the Cassette room.\n\n## Chapter 6: Reflection\\[\\]\n\nThis Cassette can be found in the first room of this chapter's third sub-chapter, \"Hollows\". To access the Cassette room, the player must use the nearby [Kevin Block](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Kevin_Blocks) to break the wall below it and send the Block to the bottom of the lake. The player must then quickly attack the Kevin Block again to make it break the wall to its left, exposing the entryway into the Cassette room.\n\n## Chapter 7: The Summit\\[\\]\n\nThis chapter's Cassette can be found in its fourth sub-chapter, \"1500M\".

After passing the house, the player must get on the first [Conveyor-Belt Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Conveyor-Belt_Platforms) in the following room and advance to the second as usual; however, on the second Conveyor-Belt Platform, the player must jump left as they're flung into the air and dash upwards to the left of the up sign, revealing a secret passage. The player must then dash to the left from there to get to the room connecting to this screen's top-left corner. After a few screens, the player will arrive at the location of a computer. Here the Crystal Heart puzzle begins.\n\nThe computer will flash a sequence of colors; nearby, there will be a number of small, colored birds, each of whom corresponds with a color that the computer flashes. The computer will flash a series of colors intermittently, followed by the birds all moving in different directions. To obtain the heart, one must pay attention to the sequence of colors that the computer flashes, as well as the directions that the birds move in every time the sequence finishes. The player must dash in the direction that each bird corresponds to in the order in the computer's light sequence where that bird's color appears on the computer (in relation to the other colors, not in real time). The direction sequence that the player must perform is:\n\n[![Celeste Birds](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e7/Celeste_Birds.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20201006071705)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e7/Celeste_Birds.png/revision/latest?cb=20201006071705)\n\nColor Directions\n\n- Up (White)\n- Left (Purple)\n- Down-Right (Blue)\n- Up-Right (Red)\n- Left (Purple)\n- Up-Left (Yellow)\n\nPerforming this series of dashes will cause the birds to form into this chapter's Crystal Heart (entitled _Pointless machines_) which the player can then obtain.\n\n## Chapter 2\\[\\]\n\n[![Resurrections](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/5/5e/Resurrections.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213173921)\n\nResurrections\n\nThe Crystal Heart in this chapter is located in [Chapter 2](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_2)'s first sub-chapter, [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Old_Site)). In theory, this Crystal Heart should be quite easy to locate, being two screens up from the starting screen of the chapter. In practice, it is very difficult to locate, as there are no [objects](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Objects) that will help one to get there. One of the ways to get there is by exploiting a piece of the game's physics that recharges the player's dash when the player moves from one screen to another. This mechanic is not directly taught in the game (although it is indirectly taught when the player attempts to collect an early strawberry in [Chapter 3](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_3:_Celestial_Resort)), and for this reason, it is regarded by many as one of the hardest Crystal Hearts to find without a guide. The mechanic allows the player to essentially climb thin air by dashing off of the right side of the first screen onto the second screen, then back, repeating until the player moves up to the screen above the first screen. After climbing up a wall from this third screen onto a fourth screen, the player can then fall down onto the third screen, dash onto the fourth screen, and repeat until one\u00a0finds a wall. The player can then climb this wall, after which the player can easily reach the topmost screen, where one can simply walk over to this chapter's Crystal Heart (entitled _Resurrections_) and obtain it.\n\nAnother way to get to this crystal heart is to first get onto the second screen, climb up the wall, stand on the left edge of the platform above the second screen, jump to the far left of the platform and then dash left as soon as the player leaves the screen. By doing so, the player lands on the platform on the left and can then continue climbing up towards the crystal heart.\n\nThe heart can also be seen (but not obtained) in the [Awake](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Awake) subchapter of Chapter 2, where it is easier to locate, and a poem lies near it with hints of how to obtain it:\n\n_An apparition_\n\n_Not of this world_\n\n_But because of it_\n\n_Lurking_ _**out of frame**_\n\n_Awake, my heart is a fortress_\n\n_**In dreams I am vulnerable**_\n\n## Chapter 3\\[\\]\n\n[![Scattered and lost](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/7/7f/Scattered_and_lost.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213174144)\n\nScattered and lost\n\nThe Crystal Heart in [Chapter 3](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_3)\u00a0is located in the second sub-chapter, [Huge Mess](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Huge_Mess). After being tasked to help clean up by Mr. Oshiro, the player must advance to the lower path of the two in the upper right corner. Once the player reaches and activates the large button to clear the purple and white towels, one must\u00a0advance not to the left as usual, but to the right. The player must then travel\u00a0up into the crevice that a stream of water is falling out of to\u00a0reveal a secret path, leading back to one of the earlier rooms of the path. One must then advance upwards and then to the left (in reverse of the way the player first goes through the area) until the player reaches the first room, where the player first runs into Theo in Chapter 3. There is a path at the top of the screen that was previously blocked by towels; the player must dash up to this path and follow it upward to find this chapter's Crystal Heart (entitled _Scattered and lost_) and obtain it.\n\n## Chapter 4\\[\\]\n\n[![Eye of the storm](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e4/Eye_of_the_storm.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213174319)\n\nEye of the storm\n\n[Chapter 4](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_4)'s Crystal Heart is located at the very beginning of the second sub-chapter, [Shrine](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Shrine). To reach the Crystal Heart, the player must cling to the [Guided Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Guided_Platforms), then navigate it left to avoid hitting the wall, after which the player should move it back to the right. Once the player lands, the player must go to the right, into the lit up area. Once one goes into the next room, the player should see a waterfall pouring into a pool of [water](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Water). The player must then swim towards the bottom right corner, and keep swimming to the right until the player reaches a hidden area with a strawberry. The player must then dash into the [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls) to the right to break it, after which the player should reach a tall room. One cannot reach the top normally; the player must crouch on top of the room's idiosyncratic white block until the player disappears. The player is now in the background instead of the foreground, thus allowing one to interact with objects in the background (a trick borrowed from [Super Mario Bros. 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3), which has a similar block with a similar gimmick). This object interaction allows the player to climb to the top of the screen, where the Crystal Heart (entitled _Eye of the storm_) is located.\n\n## Chapter 5\\[\\]\n\n[![Quiet and falling](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e2/Quiet_and_falling.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175216)\n\nQuiet and falling\n\n[Chapter 5](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_5)'s Crystal Heart is located in the second sub-chapter, [Depths](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Depths). After getting the key above the statue, the player must enter the room beneath the statue to the right, then hop on the nearby bubble and travel to the right. Instead of opening the door at the end of the room, the player must enter a second bubble and travel to the left, then dash up into the center of the second platform on their way back. This moves the player into a third bubble that they can use to travel upwards, leading to a secret path above the door. After making their way through the long hallway to reach the next room and going through that room as normal, the player must now head to the bottom of the following room and dash downwards to break the brown [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls) in the floor. This reveals another locked door that they can use the key on, which leads to the Crystal Heart's room. In order to navigate in the room, one must go along the outer edges of the room, using a set of moving blocks and platforms to get to the Crystal Heart (entitled _Quiet and falling_) and obtain it.\n\n## Chapter 6\\[\\]\n\n[![Heavy and frail](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/4/4d/Heavy_and_frail.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175253)\n\nHeavy and frail\n\n[Chapter 6](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_6:_Reflection)'s Crystal Heart is located at the beginning of the third sub-chapter, [Hollows](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Hollows). At the start of the sub-chapter, the player must use the [Angry Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Angry_Platforms) to break through the wall below to get to the first [Feather](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Feathers). One must then use it to fly up-right, and then dash down to break the [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls), revealing the second Feather. The player must use that Feather to fly upwards, then climb to the third Feather, and finally use that Feather to fly to the left of the screen, revealing an entrance to a secret room. After going through the room and breaking another Smashable Wall, the player will see a puzzle with a statue, 6 colored crystals, 4 torches and 3 symbols.\n\n[![Celeste Birds](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e7/Celeste_Birds.png/revision/latest?cb=20201006071705)\n\nBird Color Directions (see Chapter 1)\n\nIn order to solve the puzzle, one must repeat the pattern required to obtain the first chapter's Crystal Heart; doing so correctly will light up the first torch. The same thing must be done for the rest, but with slight alterations for each following torch: the second torch's pattern must be the first, but mirrored left-right (e.g an up-left on the first torch must be an up-right dash for the second); the third torch's pattern has to be mirrored up-down (e.g. an upwards dash on the first must be a downwards dash for the third), and the fourth one's pattern must be mirrored both up-down and left-right (e.g. an up-left dash on the first must be a down-right dash for the fourth). For a complete list of directions, see below:\n\n- First torch: Up, Left, Down-Right, Up-Right, Left, Up-Left\n- Second torch: Up, Right, Down-Left, Up-Left, Right, Up-Right\n- Third torch: Down, Left, Up-Right, Down-Right, Left, Down-Left\n- Fourth torch: Down, Right, Up-Left, Down-Left, Right, Down-Right\n\nAfter lighting up all 4 torches, the Crystal Heart (entitled _Heavy and frail_) will be granted on top of the statue.\n\n## Chapter 7\\[\\]\n\n[![Pink sunrise](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/c/c3/Pink_sunrise.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175701)\n\nPink sunrise\n\nTo obtain the crystal heart in [Chapter 7](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_7), you must find six Jewels hidden in each subchapter\u2014 a blue star for Reflection at the [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(The_Summit)), a sapphire square for Forsaken City at [500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/500_M), an emerald oval for Old Site at [1000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/1000_M), a gold circle for Celestial Resort at [1500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/1500_M), a pink diamond for Golden Ridge at [2000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2000_M), and a white pearl for Mirror Temple at [2500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2500_M). You obtain the crystal heart in [3000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/3000_M) after getting all the Jewels.\n\n#### Star\\[\\]\n\nThe first Jewel is located at the end of the last screen of the Start subchapter. After bouncing off of the last\u00a0[Spring](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Springs), the player must use both dashes to jump over the final\u00a0[Purple Orb](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Purple_Orbs), then climb up the wall on the right. The screen should move, revealing the first Jewel.\n\n#### Sapphire\\[\\]\n\nThe route to 500 M's Jewel starts in the sub-chapter's 3rd screen, where, after going up on the first\u00a0[Traffic Light Block](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Traffic_Light_Blocks), the player must go left instead of going right at the intersection. The player should then go right after climbing to the top of the tall screen that follows. In the following room, just to the right of the second Traffic Light Block, there is a tiny gap in the ground, which the player must fall through to find the room with the second Jewel. Completing the\u00a0spike-lined obstacle course will allow the player to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Emerald\\[\\]\n\nFor 1000 M's Jewel, the player must go through the upper left or upper right route of the 5th screen of the subchapter. If you choose the upper left route, you have to go up through the first [Space Block](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Blocks), then use the Space Block on the right to break a [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls). You will then enter into a room with a strawberry. Going up through the spiked platform will lead you to the path to the Jewel. Going the upper right route will skip the berry. The player must dash to the right in the middle of two Space Blocks to break a Smashable Wall; breaking this wall will reveal another room with [Skull Binoculars](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Skull_Binoculars), as well as with a concealed\u00a0[Disappearing Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Disappearing_Platforms) which the player must stand on to fall to the chamber below. Completing this chamber will allow the player to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Gold\\[\\]\n\n1500 M's Jewel is at the end of the 7th screen of the subchapter and is probably the easiest one to find. Below the exit upwards into the 8th screen, a broken wall can be seen. Going through there and completing the room that it reveals will allow the player to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Diamond\\[\\]\n\n2000 M's Jewel is a trek to get to. To the left of the second room is a seemingly pointless room. In one of the gaps above the player (the widest one above the pit of\u00a0[Crystal Spikes](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_Spikes)), there is a secret platform to stand on, which the player can use to jump all the way to the left of the screen. In the next screen, there is a broken area of the roof, providing another entrance to a secret platform. The player must get there, jump off to the left, dash up to the left, and then dash up as soon as the player is past the wall that they need to climb up. Going up through the hole will reveal the Jewel.\n\n#### Pearl\\[\\]\n\nTo reach 2500 M's Jewel, the player must take the first\u00a0Red Bubble\u00a0left, causing it to break the wall at the left of the first screen. The player must then enter the Red Bubble in the newly revealed screen and take that to the right, causing it to break several more walls before it eventually stops moving. The player must then go up and complete the following screen to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Crystal Heart\\[\\]\n\nAt checkpoint 28 at 3000 M, the player must dash under the gap in the wall to the player's right, causing the camera to move and reveal the room with the Crystal Heart. If the player has all of the Jewels, they will pop out of the floor, and the Crystal Heart (entitled _Pink sunrise_) will move to a place where the player can obtain it.\n\n## Chapter 8\\[\\]\n\n[![Heart of the Mountain](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/1/19/Heart_of_the_Mountain.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175751)\n\nHeart of the mountain\n\nThe Crystal Heart in [Chapter 8](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_8) is the most straightforward to obtain, as it is required to obtain at the end of the fourth subchapter, [Heart of the Mountain](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Mountain), to complete the chapter. After getting past all of the chapter's obstacles, the player can complete the level and simultaneously be awarded the Crystal Heart (entitled _Heart of the mountain_).\n\n## Trivia\\[\\]\n\n- The Jewels in [Chapter 7](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_7) appear to be based on the Jewels in the character select screen in TowerFall, matching in both shape and color.\n\nCommunity content is available under [CC-BY-SA](https://www.fandom.com/licensing) unless otherwise noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Fan Feed\n\n- [1Crystal Heart Guide](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_Heart_Guide)\n- [2Chapter 9: Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_9:_Farewell)\n- [3Madeline](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Madeline)\n\n[Follow on IG](https://bit.ly/FandomIG) [TikTok](https://bit.ly/TikTokFandom) [Join Fan Lab](https://bit.ly/FanLabWikiBar)"

Their primary purpose is to unlock different chapters locked by [Heart Doors](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Heart_Door); thus, they are also a prerequisite to unlocking all [C-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/C-Sides), [Variant Mode](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Variant_Mode), and [Golden Strawberries](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Strawberries). They also serve as chapter completion objectives for all B-Sides, all C-Sides, and [Core A-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Core#A-Side). Blue Crystal Hearts appear in every A-Side, Red Crystal Hearts in every B-Side, Gold Crystal Hearts in every C-Side, and a Gray Crystal Heart in [Farewell](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell), which is revealed to be fake and has cracks. Each Crystal Heart, except the C-Side ones, also has a name specific to itself and an associated [achievement](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Achievements) with said name.\n\nA Crystal Heart can be collected by dashing into it. In [5B](https://celeste.ink/wiki/5B), a crystal heart can also be gathered by throwing a [Theo Crystal](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Theo_Crystal) into it.\n\nAfter a heart is collected, Madeline slows down, and the game continues to run for 135 frames (~2.25 seconds) before she completely stops. It is possible to die during these 135 frames if, for instance, Madeline dashes into spikes. After the collection cutscene depicting the heart in the middle of the screen, the heart is saved and will remain in the save file indefinitely.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1A-Side Crystal Hearts](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#A-Side_Crystal_Hearts)\n- [2B-Side and C-Side Crystal Hearts](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#B-Side_and_C-Side_Crystal_Hearts)\n- [3Trivia](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#Trivia)\n- [4References](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#References)\n\n## A-Side Crystal Hearts\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?veaction=edit&section=1) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\nCrystal Hearts in A-Sides serve as well-guarded secrets, often hiding at quite a significant distance from the main path or requiring otherwise tedious tasks to be performed. These Crystal Hearts are blue, and each one has a unique name and achievement associated with it.\n\nAn exception to this rule is [Core A-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Core#A-Side): there, it acts the same way as a B-Side or a C-Side heart, being located at the end of the level, and collecting it ends the level. Such hearts also exist within various Celeste [custom maps](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Maps).\n\n[A guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2027298456) is available for anyone struggling with locating the Crystal Hearts. It contains a lot of hints and pointers before giving out the solution, so try it out!\n\n## B-Side and C-Side Crystal Hearts\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?veaction=edit&section=2) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nCrystal Hearts appear at the end of a [Cassette Block](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Block) room in every [B-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/B-Side) in _Celeste_. These Crystal Hearts are red, and each of them also has a unique name and achievement associated with it.\n\nEvery [C-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/C-Side) also contains a Crystal Heart at its end. Unlike the B-Side crystal hearts, these often aren't located at safe locations, and Madeline can die while collecting them. These Crystal Hearts are gold in color, and unlike A and B-Side Crystal hearts, they do not have an associated name or achievement. They also do not appear in the [journal](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Journal).\n\nAll B-Side and C-Side Crystal Hearts double as [golden strawberry](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_strawberry) collection triggers. The \"1000\" that appears when a strawberry is collected appears when the heart cutscene plays and remains on screen until the \"spinning heart\" animation is skipped.\n\n## Trivia\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\n- In early development, only one large heart was meant to exist in the game, and the collectables in each chapter would have been heart shards that would potentially unlock Core. It was changed to what it is now in the release version.[\\[1\\]](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#cite_note-1)\n- Every heart color plays a slightly different pitch of the collection sound.\n- Golden strawberries are saved immediately after dashing into a Crystal Heart in chapters that end with them. Dying after collecting a heart will save the golden strawberry and will respawn the player at the nearest checkpoint instead of at the beginning of the level.\n- The heart names were initially meant to be an experiment with a poem that could have possibly been reassembled in the [journal](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Journal), but the idea was never fulfilled, and realigning the hearts is purely cosmetic.[\\[2\\]](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#cite_note-2)\n - Most of the current heart names are the same as the names of one of the tracks in the chapter in A- and B-Sides. Namely, the track that the B-Side remixes is the track the A-Side heart is named after, and the B-Side heart is named after the mix's name. The only exceptions to this are 1A, 4A and 7A.\n\n## References\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?veaction=edit&section=4) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\n1.

Do not read the following section if you wish to avoid spoilers for Celestial Resort.\n\n| Show/hide content |\n| --- |\n| After leaving the ruins, [Madeline](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Madeline) arrives at a hotel. There, she finds and rings a bell with a note saying \"Please Ring for Service\". The lights go down and a ghost appears, introducing himself as the concierge of the \"world-renowned Celestial Resort Hotel\", [Mr.\u00a0Oshiro](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Mr._Oshiro). He asks Madeline for the length of her stay, to which she replies that she wants to leave and continue climbing the mountain. This makes Oshiro a bit concerned about losing a guest, so he tells Madeline that there is a world-class view of the peak in their presidential suite and offers to guide her to the room. After traversing a few rooms, Madeline tells him that the hotel is in pretty rough shape. Soon after, Madeline finds herself in a messy room full of clothes, books, and crates. Oshiro starts getting worried, realizing the hotel is a huge mess. After realizing he can't clean the whole resort alone, he gives up, but Madeline helps him. When Madeline starts cleaning, Oshiro thinks it's the power of positive thinking; however, Madeline tells him that it was her who cleaned some of the clutter. Eventually, Madeline can find a paper hidden under a pile of clothes, informing the hotel staff that the Celestial Resort is closing; this explains part of why the hotel is in such shape. She can also find [Theo](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Theo) crawling through the vents to escape the hotel, telling her to stop helping Oshiro; this fails to work, and Madeline continues cleaning. If Madeline has never seen or talked to Theo before, she will introduce herself first; if she has ignored him despite having seen him in either [Forsaken City](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City) or [Old Site](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site), she will additionally apologize for being antisocial. After cleaning up all the mess, Oshiro guides her to the presidential suite, where, en route, she again finds Theo telling her to leave. A bit later, she encounters Oshiro leaking [dust bunnies](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Dust_bunnies) out of his head due to nervousness, blocking the shortcut. This explains where all of the dust bunnies came from. Upon Madeline reaching the suite, she tells Oshiro that it is beautiful solely to avoid disappointing him (he doesn't realize this). Maddy then again states her intent, that she wants to leave to continue climbing the mountain. Oshiro's nervousness continues to manifest and makes it so that he'll give Madeline a discount. She declines, stating that she wishes to continue climbing the mountain. Oshiro begs her to stay in the hotel but is quickly interrupted by [Badeline](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Badeline), who appears in the mirror and then proceeds to shatter it, telling Oshiro that he is a loser and that the hotel is the worst place she's ever seen. Madeline attempts to calm down Oshiro, who soon enough ends up snapping and lashing out at her. Badeline tries to convince Maddy that she shouldn't be helping the creepy weirdo that Oshiro is. > \u201cThis resort is a dump. No one would ever want to stay here.\u201d > > ~ Badeline, talking to Oshiro Soon after, Oshiro starts attacking Madeline while she tries to escape the hotel on the rooftop. After a long chase sequence, Oshiro breaks the roof and makes Madeline fall onto the ground with him; he subsequently explains that he knows the hotel is a total mess and was supposed to be closed for repairs and asks her to leave him alone. |\n\n## Gameplay\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=2) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\n### A-Side\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\n| Celestial Resort\u00a0A-Side |\n| --- |\n| [![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/5/5e/3_00-d.png/510px-3_00-d.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:3_00-d.png) |\n| |\n| Level | 3A |\n| Strawberries | [![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/a/a1/Strawberry_ingame.png/28px-Strawberry_ingame.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Strawberry)**25** \u00a0\u2022 [![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/1/17/Goldberry_ingame.png/36px-Goldberry_ingame.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Strawberries) 1 |\n| Soundtrack | [Celeste OST](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_OST): _06 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0Checking In_ _07 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0Spirit of Hospitality_ _08 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0Scattered and Lost_ |\n\n| |\n| --- |\n| **Celestial Resort** [A-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/3A) \u00a0\u2022 [B-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/3B) \u00a0\u2022 [C-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/3C) |\n\nCelestial Resort's **A-Side** is the first \"indoors\" chapter in _Celeste_, and marks a notably increased level of difficulty compared to Forsaken City and Old Site. It introduces new entities to the game, most notably keys and locks, as well as omnipresent [dust bunnies](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Dust_bunnies). The chapter is also much longer than Old Site.\n\n#### Start\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=4) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\nThe chapter begins outside the resort. It features static and moving [dust bunnies](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Dust_bunnies). Madeline needs to collect a key to access the resort. More locks, which need to be unlocked, are present throughout the chapter.\n\nAfter making it to the hotel, Madeline needs to interact with the bell, triggering a cutscene and unlocking the path forward. Madeline then needs to navigate some more through the cluttered and dust-bunnies-filled hotel.\n\n#### Huge Mess\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=5) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=5)\\]\n\nThe second subchapter has three paths that can be taken in any order. At the end of each is a Clutter switch, which, when dashed into, removes certain clutter from all rooms in the hotel. This makes taking subsequent paths slightly harder but also eases navigating the main room. The top path removes the books, the middle one removes the clothes, and the bottom one removes the crates.\n\nThe available paths are initially locked. Madeline needs to interact with Mr.\u00a0Oshiro to unlock them. This interaction needs to be repeated for every path.\n\n[Theo](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Theo), who tries to escape from the hotel via the vent, can be found in the middle path. The interaction with him is **mandatory** this time.\n\nAfter all clutter is cleaned up, Madeline can access a key that opens the door to the elevator shaft.\n\n#### Elevator Shaft\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=6) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=6)\\]\n\nThe subchapter begins with a vertical elevator shaft. Madeline must use walljumps to climb it, avoiding dust bunnies that move up and down along the path.\n\nOptionally at the top of the elevator shaft the player may speak with Theo from the vent before continuing.\n\nAfter a few more rooms, Mr.\u00a0Oshiro can be found. He spews dust bunnies over the path, which block Madeline's path forward, forcing her to take a detour below. However, it is possible to [demodash](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Demodash) through this barrier.\n\n#### Presidential Suite\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=7) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=7)\\]\n\nThe Presidential Suite subchapter starts with a cutscene, after which Madeline needs to climb on the roof. There, Oshiro starts attacking Madeline, forcing her to avoid him; you can jump on him to gain height and refill a dash. The subchapter takes part primarily outdoors and features Dust Bunnies as well.\n\n### B-Side\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=8) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=8)\\]\n\nLike the A-Side, Celestial Resort's B-Side is a considerable step up in difficulty from the previous two chapters \u2015 it has the same mechanics as its A-Side counterpart, but it has far more dust bunnies and less safe ground to land on. Unlike the A-Side, Madeline doesn't need to search for clutter switches to clean up the resort. The segment where Mr.\u00a0Oshiro chases Madeline on the rooftop is much more precise, but he doesn't appear in the cassette room. Its music is notable for being, along with [Golden Ridge's B-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Ridge#B-Side), one of the only B-Side songs in Celeste that's an original composition.\n\n### C-Side\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=9) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=9)\\]\n\nCelestial Resort's C-Side contains three rooms. The first one is a short chamber with fast vertically-moving dust bunnies that need to be avoided. The second requires walljumps to complete, and the third long room reintroduces Oshiro as a boss. It is required to jump on him later in the room.\n\n## Collectables\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=10) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=10)\\]\n\nMain article: [Celestial Resort Collectables](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort/Collectables)\n\nCelestial Resort contains 25 red strawberries hidden throughout the chapter. This includes two winged strawberries, and no seeded berries are present. Additionally, a [Cassette Tape](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape) and a Blue [Crystal Heart](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart) are hidden within.\n\n## Speedrun strategies\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=11) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=11)\\]\n\n### Faster Key Grab\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=12) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=12)\\]\n\nInstead of taking the standard route to grab the key at the beginning of the chapter, speedrunners take advantage of the screen transitions refilling the dash to grab the key by simply dashing through the screen transition multiple times. This is also how you obtain the [Crystal Heart](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart) in Old Site and the second strawberry in this chapter.\n\n### Elevator Shaft demodash\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=13) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=13)\\]\n\nFollowing the cutscene where Oshiro starts spewing out [dust bunnies](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Dust_bunnies), it is possible to [demodash](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Demodash) to skip having to take a detour below. This is commonly used in any% speedruns since it can save approximately twelve seconds over the intended method.\n\n## Celeste Classic\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=14) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=14)\\]\n\nMain article: [Celeste Classic](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_Classic)\n\nA computer hidden in the \"Huge Mess\" subchapter of Chapter 3 contains the [PICO-8 version of Celeste](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_Classic), originally released in 2016. Interacting with the computer will unlock the option to play the PICO-8 version straight from the main menu.\n\n## Trivia\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?veaction=edit&section=15) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort?action=edit&section=15)\\]\n\n- Originally, the main mechanic in the chapter was going to be obstacles that would kill unless Madeline had used her dash. This was scrapped because they felt too rigid, and the dust bunnies fit the theme of the chapter more. [\\[1\\]](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort#cite_note-1)\n- The Oshiro fight was originally going to involve Madeline grabbing onto him to get through the level, this was changed because the developers felt like it was not fun.[\\[2\\]](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort#cite_note-2)\n\n1.

Both the difficulty and length of the level trump its predecessors. This haunted hotel is slammed with secrets and dangers that will put your mountain climbing skills to the test. Let\u2019s check in and go exploring!\n\nPlay\n\nBelow is a list of all 25 strawberries for this level, as well as the locations for the cassette tape and the Blue Heart. There is also a collectible easter egg in this chapter.\n\n### Strawberry \\#1\n\nThe first strawberry of the chapter is out in the open, along with a new type of enemy. The spooky black matter that go up and down will haunt you for the entire chapter. Use the spring in between them to position yourself to grab the strawberry near the bottom of the screen. Climb back up and jump to the spring to be able to use it to get to safe ground above.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/5/5c/180125_CI_C3_S1.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#2\n\nAfter encountering the black matter for the first time, hop onto the roof above them. This little path leads you to spot this strawberry, which is in a tricky spot. The key is to go over one more screen to the left. Using the raised platform there, jump and dash diagonally to the right.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/0/04/180125_CI_C3_S2_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nWhen transitioning screens, your dash is restored. Grab the edge of the spikes and then jump up and dash to the platform above the strawberry. Drop down and dash left to avoid the spikes while successfully grabbing the fruit.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/b/bc/180125_CI_C3_S2_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#3\n\nAfter meeting Mr. Oshiro, follow him into the next room. Half way through the room, you can spot the strawberry floating by a window. Jump down and then dash back up to the next platform to secure the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/a/a5/180125_CI_C3_S3.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#4\n\nWhen in the room with the key, head to the left instead of working your way around to the objective. In this next room you can walk the path below to scout out the next couple of rooms. In the first room, use the spring to grab the first block in the series of three. They will fall once grabbed onto, so jump to the second and then the third until you can dash to safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/6/65/180125_CI_C3_S4_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nYou can see the strawberry on the left side of the room. Use the disappearing blocks to jump to the strawberry and grab the wall. Slide down to avoid the moving matter and then jump up above the disappearing platform. It should return as you fall downward. Quickly move and hop back to safety. Don\u2019t leave until you go through the secret passage on the top of the screen!\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/f/fd/180125_CI_C3_S4_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#5\n\nWhen in the room with the key, head to the left instead of working your way around to the objective. In this next room you can walk the path below to scout out the next couple of rooms. In the first room, use the spring to grab the first block in the series of three. They will fall once grabbed onto, so jump to the second and then the third until you can dash to safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/f/fd/180125_CI_C3_S4_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThis is the room for Strawberry #4, but there is a secret passage in the ceiling. Dash through the indented space to find new rooms. You\u2019ll need to dash through the tight space and grab the wall on the other side. Renew your dash and stamina with the green crystal. Using the lantern as a marker, jump up and dash past the black matter to grab the wall. Jump to the adjacent wall, slide down, and hop to safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/f/f1/180125_CI_C3_S5_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nUse the green crystals in this room to dash your way across without touching the black matter. The little path on the left leads outside to the strawberry. You can use the disappearing blocks back in the room to access the lower path and walk safely back to the key room.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/b/b2/180125_CI_C3_S5_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/2/2f/180125_CI_C3_S5_C.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#6\n\nCrossing the room beyond the locked door, you can see a path upward above Mr. Oshiro. Using the right-hand side of the rightmost platform you can jump off and dash up into the passage. This leads to a room with the strawberry. Use the green crystals to navigate the room and snag the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/2/23/180125_CI_C3_S6_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/9/91/180125_CI_C3_S6_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#7\n\nAfter following Mr. Oshiro, you can spot this strawberry flying on the edge of the screen. Use the platforms to cross the room without dashing so you can grab the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/a/ad/180125_CI_C3_S7.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#8\n\nThis strawberry is along the path to get the next key you need. You can see it in the room with the spinning orbs of black matter and the lowering platforms. You need to land on the second platform then drop down to the strawberry and the adjacent left wall. When the space above you is clear, dash to the third platform and then jump to the left wall to climb out of the room.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/f/f1/180125_CI_C3_S8.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#9\n\nThere is a secret path in the room above Strawberry #8. Use the wall of towels to climb your way up to the lip in the left corner.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/5/50/180125_CI_C3_S9_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThis hidden room is a sort of \"U\" shape of platforming. Dropping down on the right-hand side, use your dashes to avoid the black matter. At the bottom of the \"U\" is the strawberry. Climb up the left side to get out. Use the disappearing platform to jump to the left wall and climb up to the next disappearing platform. Jump to the wall on the right to be higher then the final platform. Jump from there and dash upward to escape.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/1/11/180125_CI_C3_S9_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#10\n\nYou\u2019ll notice this strawberry at the top of the screen in the room with the thin columns with spikes on the top and matter creating surfaces on their sides. Jump and grab the left side of the first column. Jump off of this column and dash to the right side of the second, completely ignoring the middle area. You will use those walls to safely get the strawberry back.\n\nJump and grab the top side of the floating column, leaving the bottom half clear for later. Jump to the opposite side and then leap to the adjacent column. From there you may grab the edge of the platform beneath the strawberry, jump up and dash to the left to snag the fruit. When falling, grab one of the walls you left open to safely make it back to the ground.\n\nThis cashes in the strawberry. Hopefully you left enough of the floating column\u2019s surface clear to advance. You may also try jumping and dashing immediately to the second floating column. If you die, that\u2019s okay! Even it you die now, the strawberry is locked in.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/3/36/180125_CI_C3_S10.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#11\n\nAfter the room with the floating columns, smash the floor in the left corner. This takes you to the strawberry you saw earlier that was above the key. You need to jump between the two chunks of black matter to grab the strawberry and safely return to the other side.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/e/e5/180125_CI_C3_S11_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/c/c8/180125_CI_C3_S11_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n# Huge Mess\n\nThis portion of the chapter can be divided into three sections. You help Mr. Oshiro by cleaning up the hotel. This involves putting away the three types of clutter, which conveniently, is divided into three separate rooms. The library books are in the upper right corner, the towels in the right middle, and the boxes in the lower right corner. Each room will be separated below.\n\n## Library Books\n\n### Strawberry \\#12\n\nJust after the room with the blue heart (which is found in the towel section) you can spot this strawberry hanging precariously low over some black matter. This strawberry revolves around timing. You can walk and drop down to it and then dash to one of the two walls. Wall jump and climb your way to the top while avoiding the moving matter.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/e/ec/180125_CI_C3_S12.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#13\n\nThis strawberry can be seen in the room on the lower right near a floating column and a green crystal. If you have not cleaned up the boxes yet, this strawberry is easier to snag.\n\nSlide down the wall and leap off of it, dashing as you do so, to soar over the floating column to the strawberry. Grab the column\u2019s right wall, climb up and leap over the top to land of the left side. Line up with the green crystal, waiting if you hit it on the way over, then dash off the wall to the left. Use the second dash to safely grab on to the wall. Jump up and renew your stamina and dash with the second crystal. Jump and dash over the black matter to weave your way down to safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/7/7b/180125_CI_C3_S13.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#14\n\nBefore advancing to the next room, make your way back to the bridge of objects you walked across to enter this large room. With the books out of the way, you may now drop below to grab a hidden strawberry below.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/3/39/180125_CI_C3_S14_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/e/e2/180125_CI_C3_S14_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n## Towels\n\n### Strawberry \\#15\n\nTwo rooms after talking with Theo, you can spot this flying strawberry hiding in the lower right corner under the flow of water. Hop your way across the room without dashing, until the final column. You need to dash to lure the flying strawberry out of the water and up toward you. Jump off the wall to snag it midair and land safely on the ground below.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/c/cd/180125_CI_C3_S15.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#16\n\nThis strawberry is in the room with two tall columns of towels and a space in between them. The strawberry is beneath the flow of water in the middle. When at the top of the first purple column, drop down and pass the center block. Dash through the water to grab the strawberry and climb up the left towel column. Hop onto the center block to renew your stamina and dash. Hop over the second towel column and drop safely to the ground while avoiding the flying matter.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/4c/180125_CI_C3_S16.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Blue Heart\n\nYou may have seen the Blue Heart beneath the floor while in the library book section. After cleaning up the towels by smashing the big magical button, do not climb out of the room on the left. Instead, dash up through the water on the right.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/0/01/180125_CI_C3_BH_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nYou now have to platform back to the room where you spoke to Theo. Once back in the room, dash into the upper left corner to find the path to the blue heart. Dash into it to collect!\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/e/ee/180125_CI_C3_BH_C.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/d/d8/180125_CI_C3_BH_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Pico-8 Easter Egg\n\nPlay\n\nAfter exiting the towel area, you can access a small laundry area through a entry way in the main room. This room is in the right middle as well, slightly above the lower right entry to the box area. There is a small note about the hotel in the laundry. In the upper area is a small path that leads to a computer room.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/c/cc/180125_CI_C3_P_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThe computer is a Pico-8 which is game development software, similar in limitation to the Gameboy. On it you can play the original Celeste! Play as much as you want now. When you wrap up, it will be permanently playable from the main menu. Beat it for an achievement/trophy!\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/0/00/180125_CI_C3_P_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n## Boxes\n\n### Strawberry \\#17\n\nThe room after using the switch to open a pathway is a tight corridor area. The tight space makes for precision platforming. In the lower right corner, in the path of some flying black matter, is a pathway to a strawberry room.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/8/81/180125_CI_C3_S17_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nIn the strawberry room, you have to treat the walls like a game of \"the floor is lava.\" On the first column, stick to the left half. Dash upward and climb onto the floating square. Drop down and dash to the right. Climb the right wall, then jump to get the strawberry. When falling down, dash to the left onto the safe square on the ground. Climb the right side of the first column and then jump to safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/a/a7/180125_CI_C3_S17_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#18 (Not the 18th)\n\nOn your way up to the button you will see this strawberry on the left. Dash up between the matter to the top of the column, saving half the floor for a safe return. Drop to the ground, again saving some space for the return journey. Dash diagonally into the left wall, above the moving matter. Wall jump to the right and grab the strawberry. Maneuver your way down to ground platform, using the safe spaces you left yourself. Climb out of the area to secure the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/4f/180125_CI_C3_S18.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n## Elevator Shaft\n\n### Strawberry \\#19\n\nAfter the room with the four switches, you\u2019ll enter a long, perilous stretch of room. The strawberry is at the to middle. To nab it requires hopping over parts of the floor to leave a safe area for the journey back.\n\nDash over the diagonal matter and land in the center of the bottom floor. From here, jump in between the trash can and bookcase. Now jump out and dash straight up to land of the rightmost portion of the first self platform, leaving the left for later. Do the same for the shelf above, grabbing the left edge of it to make sure you can make the jump. Now dash to the right to get the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/d/d5/180125_CI_C3_S19_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nLand below on the right half of the bottom floor, which should be clear. Hop into the holes you made before all the way to the edge. Jump up to the shelves, using the clear areas on the left. Once on the top shelf, jump out and dash to the left to hit the green crystal. Weave through the matter and dash to the safe ground. Grab the left wall, jump off and dash up to grab the right wall. Then jump to the top left corner for safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/1/13/180125_CI_C3_S19_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#20\n\nThis strawberry is in the room with the locked door on the left. The strawberry itself is in the lower right corner. You need to drop down to the floor and dodge the moving matter. Get to the right edge, while saving some floor for the return, and dash up in between to two orbs. Grab the wall and jump to the adjacent wall to snag the floating strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/4b/180125_CI_C3_S20_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nDrop down and move to grab the right wall. Then when the path is clear, jump back to the floor. Climb the column in the center and drop to the left side for safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/1/1c/180125_CI_C3_S20_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#21\n\nThe room to the left of the locked door has a small gap in the floor right by the entrance. Drop down inside to find two strawberries. For the strawberry on the right, climb the right wall and dash upward when the coast is clear. Hitting the crystal on the way, grab the rightmost wall and slide down. Dash to the left to grab the strawberry. Climb up the wall and jump over when the orbs of matter are out of the way. Fall to the floor to secure the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/f/fa/180125_CI_C3_S21.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#22\n\nThe room to the left of the locked door has a small gap in the floor right by the entrance. Drop down inside to find two strawberries. For the strawberry on the left, dash up through the black matter and fall to the ground. Save some space for the return. Climb up the left wall, avoiding the orb, and grab the strawberry. Slide down the left wall and hop back to the safe ground you left. Climb the wall and dash up when it is clear and fall to the ground for safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/1/1a/180125_CI_C3_S22.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Cassette Tape\n\nAfter grabbing the key, enter the glowing room to the left. This is the cassette room. The blue and pink platforms alternate based off the beat of the music. Time your jumps to navigate the room on the alternating platforms to grab the tape. This unlocks Chapter 3\u2019s B Side level.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/1/16/180125_CI_C3_CT.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n## Presidential Suite\n\nThese strawberries must be collected during the boss chase with Mr. Oshiro!\n\n### Strawberry \\#23\n\nWhen you first come across switches in the chase, you\u2019ll be near the strawberry. When grabbing the second switch, you need to bounce off of Mr. Oshiro\u2019s head in order to get enough height to clear the black matter and grab the floating strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/a/af/180125_CI_C3_S23.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#24\n\nThis strawberry is easy to spot. During the chase, you see a small structure that you have to go through. The strawberry is at the top. Climb the left wall and jump through the gap to grab the strawberry and land on the other side.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/d/d4/180125_CI_C3_S24.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#25\n\nThe final strawberry for chapter 3 is at the tail end of the chase. You\u2019ll see it hanging low over some black matter. Drop down and dash to the right to snag it and grab the wall. Climb up to secure it!\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/4f/180125_CI_C3_S25.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Up Next: Chapter 4- Golden Ridge\n\n[Previous\\\n\\\nChapter 2- Old Site](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Chapter_2-_Old_Site) [Next\\\n\\\nChapter 4- Golden Ridge](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Chapter_4-_Golden_Ridge)\n\n### Top Guide Sections\n\n- [Walkthrough](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Walkthrough)\n- [Tips and Tricks](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Tips_and_Tricks)\n- [Strawberries](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Strawberries)\n- [Cassette Tapes](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Cassette_Tapes)\n\n### Was this guide helpful?\n\nLeave feedback\n\n### In This Guide\n\n[![Celeste](https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/01/23/celeste---button-1516746065043.jpg?width=114&crop=1%3A1%2Csmart&auto=webp&dpr=2)](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\n[Celeste](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\n[Matt Makes Games Inc.](https://www.ign.com/games/producer/matt-makes-games-inc) Jan 25, 2018\n\n[Xbox Series X\\|S](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/xbox-4) [Stadia](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/stadia) [Xbox One](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/xbox-one) [PlayStation 4](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/ps4)\n\n+2\n\n[Learn more](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\nGo to comments"

The subchapter sees the player coming across [Mr. Oshiro's](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Oshiro) resort and meeting him for the first time. [Dust bunnies](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Objects#Sludge), as well as their moving sludge and circling sludge variants, appear here as the main focus. Some other things introduced in this subchapter are keys, locks, shimmer blocks, sinking platforms, moving platforms, and sludge-spawning tiles. A room with the [Cassette](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Cassette_Guide) to unlock Chapter 3's B-Side can be found, but it's merely a preview and can't be played through.\n\n## **Gameplay**\\[\\]\n\nMadeline starts off outside of the resort and has to traverse a few rooms before reaching the entrance. The resort has to be unlocked with a key located in the fourth room, which can be reached by climbing the floating platforms and dashing across. Another method to reach it is by dashing diagonally upward before entering the screen transition and then dashing again to reach the key from the left. Mr. Oshiro can be summoned in the first room inside the resort by ringing a bell. He then tries to persuade Madeline to stay in the resort, but Madeline refuses and just wants to pass through.\n\nThe following rooms can be fairly tricky compared to rooms in the last 2 chapters. Circling sludge makes up much of the challenge and timing your dashes inbetween them can be difficult. Wait until the time you think is best to dash past the circling sludge and then wait until you're comfortable doing it again. When stalling on sinking platforms to time your next move, make sure to be constantly jumping so the platform doesn't fall too far down.\n\nKeys will be required to progress, so the player will need to take detours through other rooms to collect the key and unlock the rest of the area. In the sixteenth room of the subchapter are 4 key tokens to be collected in order to unlock the key-activated platform. Try to walk on the bottom spring as the moving spring on the left is at its left-most point, then bounce into the top-left token and dash to the right. From there, climb the platform and collect the next token, then fall down to grab the token hovering above the dust bunnies and diagonally dash upward to the floating platforms. For a safety net, you might want to wait until the moving platforms with springs are in line to be there when you dash. Lastly, simply jump into the bottom-right key token and climb the wall. The next room is also tricky, so to get it consistently just walk back and forth to avoid the dust bunnies as you sink and then jump to the left and dash directly up. Climb this wall and jump into the dash crystal before timing your dash carefully to make it inbetween the dust bunnies.\n\n### **Strawberries**\\[\\]\n\nThere are 11 Strawberries found in this subchapter (not including the Golden Strawberry which spawns in the first room).\n\nBerry 1\n\nFound in the third room of the subchapter, this Strawberry is found floating low in the air below the second moving sludge. Stay bouncing on the spring until the moving sludge is at its highest, then move right and grab the wall after touching the berry and climb up. You can then either dash straight up after jumping off the wall or dash back onto the spring.\n\nBerry 2\n\nFound in the third room of the subchapter, you can only access this berry by going above the main section of the room. At the end of the room, go back left over the roof and back at the left you can see the Strawberry hovering around spikes. Dash diagonally back and forth through this room and the one to the left to reach the platform. Walk off the platform to hit the Strawberry then dash directly to the left.\n\nBerry 3\n\nFound in the sixth room of the subchapter, this Strawberry is floating near a cluster of dust bunnies. Stand on the fourth floating platform (at the top-left of the dust bunnies) and walk off the right at the time the circling sludge moves past the bottom-right of Madeline, then dash straight left to land on the green platform.\n\nBerry 4\n\nA hidden area can be found by walking through the bottom-left of the eighth room of the subchapter (which has the second key of the subchapter). In the room you arrive in, walk into the spring on the floor and grab onto the falling platform. When this platform starts falling, jump and grab the next falling platform, then do it again for the last one. Dash left after this third falling platform starts to fall. In the room to the left, this Strawberry is found. Jump left when the moving sludge on the right is moving up, wait a bit, then jump left again and dash directly left without touching the disappearing platform. Then, jump off the wall after claiming the Strawberry and you can make it back by jumping and dashing when you wish.\n\nBerry 5\n\nTo get to this berry, follow the same route to reach the previous berry. A smashable wall is found on the ceiling of the room where the 4th berry is located in, so dash into this ceiling to continue. In the next room, jump and dash straight left to get past the narrow gap with the dust bunnies. Touch the dash crystal and make your way up the corridor, then dash to the left at the top and slide down the left wall, jumping before you land in the dust bunnies, and do the same for the wall you land at. After a transition from a previous room, another room has to be completed. Dash directly into both dash crystals and wait before dashing the last time underneath the floating dust bunny. After this, you can go left to find the Strawberry in a balcony over a previous room.\n\nBerry 6\n\nIn the ninth room of the subchapter, a vertical transition can be seen to the top-left of where Mr. Oshiro is waiting. Wait on the last sinking platform to jump to the floating platform furthest to the right, then climb up and jump off the right side and dash diagonally upward to the right to climb the corridor. In this room above, the strategy is just dashing directly into every dash crystal. Slide down the right wall to grab the Strawberry and jump off the wall, then dash back to the left to get back to safety.\n\nBerry 7\n\nIn the eleventh room of the subchapter, a Winged Strawberry is seen at the end. Climb up the first platform and jump over to get to the next one. Jump to the third platform to climb up and jump over it, then stick to the right side of the fourth platform and jump off. From there, grab the berry.\n\nBerry 8\n\nFound in the fourteenth room of the subchapter, this Strawberry is seen floating underneath the leftmost sinking platform. Aim to run off the platform while both circling sludges are far away and grab the wall until you're comfortable dashing out of the pit to climb to safety.\n\nBerry 9\n\nIn the fifteenth room of the subchapter, a hidden path can be found above where you start. Upon entering the room, you should first walk into the hole and dash to the left to land on the platform. Go right and then dash left again and slide down the wall to then jump off and land on another, lower platform. Jump into the gap inbetween the dust bunnies and dash left, then you can reach the Strawberry. However, you need to get out of the area before being able to claim the Strawberry. Start climbing the left wall and dash to any nearby disappearing platform to refresh your stamina when needed.\n\nBerry 10\n\nFound in the fifteenth room of the subchapter, this Strawberry is floating at the top over some spikes. You have to approach this berry carefully to not make your return impossible due to overlapping with sludge-spawning tiles you already went past. From the start of the room, jump across the first set of dust bunnies and climb the wall you reach. Jump off this wall and dash over the next wall to reach the next platform. Jump to the floating platform and then jump at the top to the other side, then wall jump to the other floating platform. This is the trickiest part, and it has to be done quickly. Jump to the platform which the berry is hovering over, then jump up and dash to the left. To survive, wall jump off the right side of the very first wall you climbed over and climb up right left side of the wall opposite of it. To continue the room without a death, do a wall jump off the left and dash diagonally up-right to grab the rightmost floating platform, then jump over that to move on.\n\nBerry 11\n\nOn the right side of the fifteenth room of the subchapter, a smashable wall is located on the floor. This will take you to a spot above a previous room with 2 moving sludges in a narrow corridor. Start running right as soon as the moving sludge on the floor starts moving right, then shortly after jump and dash right to reach the berry. Standing on the elevated floor where the Strawberry resided, dash to the left as soon as the moving sludge on the floor starts moving right and continue left quickly to get out.\n\n##
