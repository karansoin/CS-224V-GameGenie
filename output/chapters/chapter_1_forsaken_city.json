From there, head left, and continue through another (relatively harder) room with two zippers. Once you're outside of the city, and can hear the \"Piano Only\" version of _First Steps_, jump and dash left until you find the satellite, collecting the strawberry on your way.\n\nA computer screen there goes through a specific cycle of colors: **white \u00a0\u2022 purple \u00a0\u2022 blue \u00a0\u2022 red \u00a0\u2022 purple \u00a0\u2022 yellow**. After that, several birds will start flying in different directions: the white bird will fly **up**, the purple bird **left**, the blue bird **down-right**, the red bird **up-right**, the purple bird (again) **left**, and then the yellow bird **up-left**.\n\nDash following the order the colors flash, in the directions the colors are associated with. It is easiest to do this on the platform a little left of the computer screen. Therefore, dash **up, left, down-right, up-right, left, and up-left**. Once that's done (there is no time limit, you just need to dash in order), a blue crystal heart will appear. Collecting the crystal heart will yield you the **Pointless machines** achievement.\n\n## Cassette Tape\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=2) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nRight at the Chasm checkpoint, move the block out of the way, and head to the other side of it. Head upwards and you will discover another room, one with paths towards strawberries 16 and 17. A zipper on the ground can be used to boost upwards; use that to make it up.\n\nYou'll find another room, with a zipper stuck on the wall. Move the zipper out of the way, and head behind it. This will lead you to a cassette tape room. Cassette tape rooms feature alternating blue and pink blocks, which alternate to a beat synchronized with an 8-bit version of the level's music. Time your jumps and make it to the cassette. This unlocks [Forsaken City B-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1B).\n\n## Strawberries\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\n### Start\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=4) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\n#### Strawberry 1\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=5) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=5)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/7/75/Ch1a_1.png/800px-Ch1a_1.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_1.png)\n\nYour first strawberry is found on the second screen of the subchapter, requiring you to jump up using the spring and dash upwards to reach it. Land on the ground, and there you go!\n\n#### Strawberry 2\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=6) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=6)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/8/8b/Ch1a_2.png/800px-Ch1a_2.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_2.png)\n\nOn the third screen; you need to jump off the block at the end of the room, collect the berry, quickly dash up to avoid falling into a spike pit, and grabbing up a wall.\n\n#### Strawberry 3\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=7) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=7)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/6/6a/Ch1a_3.png/800px-Ch1a_3.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_3.png)\n\nOn the fourth screen; this is a flying strawberry. To collect it, use the disappearing platforms at the right of the screen to jump upwards towards on top, and then jump off the left side to collect the berry. An alternative speedrun-specific strategy involves the use of [Wallbounces](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Wallbounces).\n\n#### Strawberry 4\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=8) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=8)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/7/73/Ch1a_4.png/800px-Ch1a_4.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_4.png)\n\nThe room after the flying strawberry, on your left, when you find a glowing light, go left. Hidden behind a small challenge, collecting this berry involves scaling up a small ice wall with a few spikes here and there. Dashing rightwards after falling down, at the left, will net you the berry.\n\n#### Strawberry 5\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=9) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=9)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/a/ab/Ch1a_5.png/800px-Ch1a_5.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_5.png)\n\nBoost off the zipper left-upwards, and climb onto the right side of the ice block with spikes on top. Jump off upwards, and dash left-upright to collect the strawberry.\n\n#### Strawberry 6\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=10) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=10)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/0/0c/Ch1a_6.png/800px-Ch1a_6.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_6.png)\n\nIn the same room as strawberry 5, instead of heading upwards using the spring, which is how you would normally progress, head downwards, leaning on the right wall. An ice block can be seen: dash on it to destroy the block. In the room that follows, jump downwards, dash onto and hold the zipper, and jump onto it as it stops; subsequently jump to where the strawberry is. Jump off leftwards and dash up-left, through the floor, to get back to safety.\n\n### Crossing\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=11) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=11)\\]\n\n#### Strawberry 7\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=12) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=12)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/5/50/Ch1a_7.png/800px-Ch1a_7.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_7.png)\n\nTo reach this berry, instead of going to the right in the first room of crossing, go left into the room, and then dash into the dash refill and dash again, then climb up to the next screen. Jump over the first spring and jump on the second one, grab the wall and then jump above it, dash diagonally in the upper left corner into the refill and repeat the dash. You can also find [Theo](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Theo) right after the berry or when going left instead of up.\n\n#### Strawberry 8\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=13) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=13)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/6/60/Ch1a_8.png/800px-Ch1a_8.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_8.png)\n\nAt the start of Crossing, go on the higher platform, jump and dash diagonally in the upper right corner, collecting the refill and again dashing to the right, then instead of going up dash into the first block under the exit of the screen, which makes an exit appear in a small hidden path with the berry.\n\n#### Strawberry 9\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=14) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=14)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/7/73/Ch1a_9.png/800px-Ch1a_9.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_9.png)\n\nIn the third room of Crossing, the one with two zippers (one heading right straight into spikes, and the other heading upwards), use the first zipper normally, jump onto the second one, and boost up-leftwards to where an \"up arrow\" sign can be seen. From there, head left, and continue through another (relatively harder) room with two zippers. Once you're outside of the city, and can hear the \"Piano Only\" version of _First Steps_, jump and dash left until you find the satellite, collecting the strawberry on your way. Don't forget to collect the [Crystal Heart](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectibles#Crystal_Heart) while you're here!\n\n#### Strawberry 10\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=15) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=15)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/5/5a/Ch1a_10.png/800px-Ch1a_10.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_10.png)\n\nIn the fourth room of the sub-chapter, go up with the spring and dash into the block of ice, revealing a small room, dash diagonally in the upper left corner three times, grab the berry, walljump into the refill, diagonally dash in the upper right corner into the refill and do the same again.\n\n#### Strawberry 11\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=16) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=16)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/f/f6/Ch1a_11.png/800px-Ch1a_11.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_11.png)\n\nReach the room mentioned above in Strawberry 10, but instead of heading back after getting the berry, climb up on a floating block and then dash into an odd-looking tile on the ceiling, leading you to a secret room. After beating it you will enter another room, where you can find the berry and go back to the main trial.\n\n#### Strawberry 12\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=17) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=17)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/e/e1/Ch1a_12.png/800px-Ch1a_12.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_12.png)\n\nIn the seventh room after the checkpoint, you can find a small hole in the ground, which you can dash into instead of dashing onto the crumbling blocks; in the room you just entered jump on the 3 zipper blocks, grab the berry and wait a bit on the wall for the traffic light blocks to come back to their original position and come back to the entrance.\n\n#### Strawberry 13\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=18) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=18)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/5/51/Ch1a_13.png/800px-Ch1a_13.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_13.png)\n\nThe strawberry is located again in room 7, but this time, instead of going to the right to leave the room, go up and find another section with the berry, grab the zipper block and climb onto the wall. If you jump off the traffic light block, you will immediately get launched into spikes; jump on the other, smaller zipper, when it reaches its leftmost point, jump off of it, grab the wall and walljump off of it to get the berry.\n\n#### Strawberry 14\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=19) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=19)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/c/c6/Ch1a_14.png/800px-Ch1a_14.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_14.png)\n\nIn the eighth room, jump on the edge of the first zipper and use the boost from jumping off of it while it's going up to jump between the spikes surrounding the berry and if necessary dash up to grab it.\n\n#### Strawberry 15\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=20) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=20)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/9/9a/Ch1a_15.png/800px-Ch1a_15.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Ch1a_15.png)\n\nIn the ninth and final room of Crossing, to reach the berry you can jump off a 2-tile wide platform, dash up to grab the zipper from the right side, when the zipper is on the right side jump off of it to quickly grab the berry, jump on the zipper and then jump up\n\n### Chasm\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=21) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=21)\\]\n\n#### Strawberry 16\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=22) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=22)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/5/5e/Fc_16_1.png/800px-Fc_16_1.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Fc_16_1.png)\n\nAt the first room of Chasm, go left by grabbing the zipper and jump dash over it. Go into the room and go the down path by dashing over the zipper. Then, go on the spring in the next room and jump on it, then quickly jump down on the platform and go up. When outside, just jump down and dash back up after walljumping. Then just go back right by jumping down to the platform and dashing to the spring and dashing after the spike platform.\n\n#### Strawberry 17\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?veaction=edit&section=23) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables?action=edit&section=23)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/1/12/Forsaken_City_berry_17.jpg/800px-Forsaken_City_berry_17.jpg)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Forsaken_City_berry_17.jpg)\n\nFollow the same path as for the previous berry but go up from the first room instead of left.

It teaches you the basics of maneuvering and maintaining enough stamina, wile using the environment to the best of your ability. It also happens to be a dense level, packed with collectibles and secret rooms.\n\nPlay\n\nBelow is a list of all 20 strawberries for this level, as well as the locations for the cassette tape and the Crystal Heart.\n\n## Start\n\n### Strawberry \\#1\n\nThe first strawberry is right out in the open on the second screen of the chapter. Use the spring to gain height and dash into the strawberry. Touch the ground to lock it in!\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/c/cf/180124_CI_C1_S1.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#2\n\nOn the screen immediately after the first strawberry is the second!

Jump and dash upward to make it to the landing in the middle. You can grab the wall if you need to climb up. Using the spring, hop over the spikes and fall gracefully downward, using your dash to collect the strawberry and land safely.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/7/7c/180124_CI_C1_S4.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#5\n\nThe screen above the flying strawberry, use the lift on the right to fling yourself up and to the left. Use your dash to grab the strawberry in the upper left corner.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/1/13/180124_CI_C1_S5.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#6\n\nIn the same room as Strawberry #5 is a breakable block in the lower right corner. Dash through it to find the sixth strawberry\u2019s location. Drop through the spikes and dash to the geared platform. Ride it and jump off toward the strawberry. Catch a ride back and dash through the floor above to safely clear the room.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/48/180124_CI_C1_S6_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/e/e2/180124_CI_C1_S6_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n## Crossing\n\n### Strawberry \\#7\n\nThis strawberry is in a room above the character Theo. To find Theo, go left from the room with a green crystal in the center. Jump and dash diagonally to the left to hit the green crystal in this new room and dash again to make it to safe ground. Climb up the wall on the left to find a hidden area.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/8/87/180124_CI_C1_S7_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nWatch out for the spring on the ground beneath the spikes! Hop over the hazard and use the second spring to launch toward the wall. Grab it and jump over the spikes toward the green crystal. Dash toward safety and the strawberry. Drop down the passage on the left to see Theo.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/d/d2/180124_CI_C1_S7_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#8\n\nBack in the room with the green crystal in the center (Reference photo above in Strawberry #7), make your way to the right. Climb up and dash above the crystal so you fall on it to regain your dash. Before hitting the spikes, dash to the right on safe ground. Instead of jumping up, dash through the brown rock to find a hidden strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/41/180124_CI_C1_S8.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#9\n\nIn the room with the two geared platforms (one that launches you to the right, the other upward), there is a secret passage that leads to the upper left corner. Using the upward geared platform, jump and dash into the small crevice next to the up arrow sign. This reveals the passage to the left corner.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/1/14/180124_CI_C1_S9_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nTo clear this room, you need to overcome two geared platform obstacles. Wall jump to reach the top of the first, grab on to activate it and then quickly let go and dash over the spikes. Grab the second block and ride it all the way to the left. Climb in the small alcove above and let the platform pass beneath you. Climb onto the left side of the block and ride it back over. Wall jump your way out and go left.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/2/24/180124_CI_C1_S9_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nDash through the air onto the only platforms until you reach the satellite where the strawberry is.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/a/ac/180124_CI_C1_S9_C.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Crystal Heart\n\nStick around at the satellite to find Chapter 1\u2019s Crystal Heart. The birds are the key to this puzzle. After the computer beeps through a cycle, the birds strike a pose. Each color goes to the same spot. These locations are actually directions to dash in and the computer cycle is the order in which you need to dash.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/f/fe/180129_CI_C1_CH_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThe solution is Up, Left, Down-Right, Up-Right, Left, Up-Left. Dash in those directions and the Crystal Heart will appear.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/6/68/180129_CI_C1_CH_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#10\n\nContinuing to go to the right, after the room with the secret passage in the center, hop on the spring and break the block in the upper left corner. Inside is a room with two green crystals, a spiked floor, Strawberry #10, AND the passage to the next collectible piece of fruit.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/e/eb/180124_CI_C1_S10.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nUse the crystals to make it to the far wall, wait for them to regenerate and then return safely to the right side of the screen with the fruit.\n\n### Strawberry \\#11\n\nIn the same room as Strawberry #10, climb the right-hand wall to reach the sole platform. Jump out into the middle and dash upward to find a new screen.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/5/53/180124_CI_C1_S11_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nClimb through this room, using the falling blocks and the geared platform to make it to the top. In the following room, you\u2019ll spot the strawberry. Dash and climb your way to the brown platform. Drop down to the strawberry and dash in between the spikes to collect the green crystal. With your dash restored, dash diagonally upward to safety.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/f/fd/180124_CI_C1_S11_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#12\n\nAdvance a few couple more rooms until you reach the room with the floating column topped with spikes in the center.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/9/9a/180124_CI_C1_S12_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nBefore leaving the room by going to the right, there are two other rooms that house strawberries. One of them is at the top and the other is at the bottom.\n\nUsing the column in the center, climb up to the platform in the left corner to regain your dash. Hop to the right side of the column and then leap to the disappearing block platform. Jump straight up to the small wooden ledge and climb into the room above.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/6/66/180124_CI_C1_S12_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nUse the geared platforms to go around the room and get the strawberry. Be careful to not jump off of the first platform too soon or the momentum will carry you into the spikes above. When on the horizontal-moving platform, use its momentum to leap down to the strawberry, dashing to clear the spikes on the ground.\n\n### Strawberry \\#13\n\nBack in the center room, you can see a small path on the floor that drops into a room below. You need to drop down above the spikes and then dash into the small path.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/7/7d/180124_CI_C1_S13.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nIn the room below, you simply need to hop across all three geared platforms to grab the strawberry at the end. Hold onto the wall until they reset and then hop your way back to safety.\n\n### Strawberry \\#14\n\nThis strawberry is out in the open, in between walls of spikes at the top of the screen. Use the momentum of the upward moving geared platforms in the room to launch close to the fruit and then dash upward to nab it. Be careful to not dash too high up or you\u2019ll hit the spikes. Continue out of the room to lock in the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/2/27/180124_CI_C1_S14.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#15\n\nThis strawberry requires you to be quick with your wall jumps. Out in the open as well, ride the geared platform on its left side. At the end, climb up to safety and recharge your stamina. Drop down and dash to the left to grab onto the geared platform, this time on its right-hand side. When it stops, jump off to grab the strawberry and then quickly wall jump back. Jump up to solid ground and lock in the fruit.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/0/00/180124_CI_C1_S15.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n## Chasm\n\n### Strawberry \\#16\n\nTo find the next couple of strawberries, you\u2019ll need to get behind the geared platform in the open room. Grab onto it, ride it to a stop, then hop and dash over it to slip behind it into this new area.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/6/65/180124_CI_C1_S16_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nSkip over the geared platform in the floor and continue to the left. In the next room, use the blade of grass as a marker for how long your dash is. Dash to the spring on the floor and use its lift to safely dash to the wooden platform above. Drop down to the ledge with the green sign and then climb out of this room.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/5/56/180124_CI_C1_S16_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nOutside is the strawberry. Drop down to get it and then climb back up the wall to get to solid ground.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/6/63/180124_CI_C1_S16_C.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Cassette Tape\n\nBack in the room with the geared platform in the floor, use its upward momentum to fling you to the ground above. Head into the next room to find a geared platform in the wall. Before using it to get the tantalizing strawberry on the right, activate it and sneak into the room behind it that is emitting a glow.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/a/af/180124_CI_C1_Cassette.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThis is a cassette tape room. The blue and pink platforms alternate based off the beat of the music. Time your jumps to navigate the room on the alternating platforms to grab the tape. This unlocks Chapter 1\u2019s B Side level.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/c/cb/180124_CI_C1_Cassette_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#17\n\nBack in the room with the geared platform in the floor, use its upward momentum to fling you to the ground above. Head into the next room to see your next strawberry. After getting the Cassette Tape, use the geared platform to fling yourself across the room to the strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/a/af/180124_CI_C1_Cassette.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#18\n\nThis strawberry is clear as day in the chasm room. Use the geared platform to launch yourself across the room. When beneath the strawberry\u2019s location, dash up to snag it.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/4/4d/180124_CI_C1_S18.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#19\n\nAfter snagging Strawberry #18, hop through the floor and go to the right. This room contains another flying strawberry. Use the geared platofrm to launch across the room to the disappearing blocks. Climb the right-hand wall up to the spring and grab the flying fruit.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/c/c2/180124_CI_C1_S19.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Strawberry \\#20\n\nIn the spike room with the blocks that fall when you grab them will be the hiding spot for this strawberry.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/6/69/180124_CI_C1_S20_A.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThe block in the upper left corner will drop down if you grab it. Drop the block and then dash into the wall that was behind it to reveal a hidden path.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/5/53/180124_CI_C1_S20_B.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\nThe next screen reveals the strawberry. Use the green crystals to make your way up and around the spikes, grabbing the strawberry along the way.\n\n![](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/celeste/d/d9/180124_CI_C1_S20_C.png?width=200&quality=20&dpr=0.05)\n\n### Up Next: Chapter 2- Old Site\n\n[Previous\\\n\\\nWalkthrough](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Walkthrough) [Next\\\n\\\nChapter 2- Old Site](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Chapter_2-_Old_Site)\n\n### Top Guide Sections\n\n- [Walkthrough](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Walkthrough)\n- [Tips and Tricks](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Tips_and_Tricks)\n- [Strawberries](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Strawberries)\n- [Cassette Tapes](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Cassette_Tapes)\n\n### Was this guide helpful?\n\nLeave feedback\n\n### In This Guide\n\n[![Celeste](https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/01/23/celeste---button-1516746065043.jpg?width=114&crop=1%3A1%2Csmart&auto=webp&dpr=2)](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\n[Celeste](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\n[Matt Makes Games Inc.](https://www.ign.com/games/producer/matt-makes-games-inc) Jan 25, 2018\n\n[Xbox Series X\\|S](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/xbox-4) [Stadia](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/stadia) [Xbox One](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/xbox-one) [PlayStation 4](https://www.ign.com/games/platform/ps4)\n\n+2\n\n[Learn more](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\nGo to comments"

In order to complete this challenge, players need to abuse the game's lenient hitboxes and \"coyote frames\" in order to perform very tight and difficult jumps. The player also has to learn a technique called \"neutral jumping\", which will be needed in a few sections towards the end. If the player manages to complete the chapter without dashing even once, a flying Golden Strawberry will appear on the last screen.\n\nUnlike all other Golden Strawberries, the player doesn't have to complete this chapter without dying in order to get it.\n\n## **Plot**\\[\\]\n\n**I tried to warn you.**\n\nThis section contains spoilers for Chapter 1: Forsaken City. Do not read the following section if you wish to avoid spoilers for Chapter 1: Forsaken City.\n\n[Madeline](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Madeline) travels through the titular Forsaken City, finding another hiker, Theo, about halfway through the level. Madeline and Theo converse, and Theo explains that he came to Celeste Mountain to explore and to take pictures, although Madeline avoids explaining why she came to Celeste Mountain. The two also discuss the origins of the Forsaken City, with Madeline explaining that a mega-corporation started building the city, but nobody wanted to live there, although neither of them know why. Madeline also expresses a desire to reach the summit of Celeste Mountain, something that Theo does not seem as interested in doing. Eventually, Madeline returns to climbing Celeste Mountain. At the end of the level, she encounters a memorial (entitled the Celeste Memorial), decides to stop there and make camp for the night, and goes to sleep, thinking that climbing Celeste Mountain might have been a mistake.\n\n**Show/Hide Content**\n\n## **Speedrunning Record Progression**\\[\\]\n\nOn 27 November 2018, Buhbai achieved 1:30 in City B, obtaining the first ever full sweep of a level.\n\nClear (1A):\n\n| Name | Time | Date | Days Standing |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Forsaken | 1:04.770 | 12/2/2018 | 11 |\n| Forsaken | 1:04.107 | 23/2/2018 | 12 |\n| Forsaken | 1:03.614 | 7/3/2018 | 62 |\n| DemoJameson | 1:02.662 | 8/5/2018 | 4 |\n| McBoi | 1:02.288 | 12/5/2018 | 14 |\n| McBoi | 1:02.135 | 26/5/2018 | 4 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:01.897 | 30/5/2018 | 8 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:01.166 | 7/6/2018 | 1 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:00.588 | 8/6/2018 | 5 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:00.095 | 13/6/2018 | 28 |\n| Hornlitz | 59.867 | 11/7/2018 | 81 |\n| Jumpyluff | 59.755 | 30/9/2018 | 6 |\n| Buhbai | 59.262 | 6/10/2018 | 147 |\n| UltraMarlin | 58.871 | 2/3/2019 | 17 |\n| FPlush | 58.514 | 19/3/2019 | 14 |\n| Zkad | 58.242 | 2/4/2019 | 9 |\n| Zkad | 58.089 | 11/4/2019 | 4 |\n| Zkad | 57.987 | 15/4/2019 | 30 |\n| FPlush | 57.868 | 15/5/2019 | 1 |\n| Zkad | 57.460 | 16/5/2019 | 23 |\n| FPlush | 57.103 | 8/6/2019 | 17 |\n| Zkad | 56.678 | 25/6/2019 | 99 |\n| Zkad | 56.644 | 2/10/2019 | 3 |\n| Zkad | 56.457 | 5/10/2019 | 4 |\n| Zkad | 56.151 | 9/10/2019 | 5 |\n| **Zkad** | **55.998** | **14/10/2019** | **127+** |\n| UltraMarlin\\* | 58.140 | 26/6/2019 | 0 |\n\n_Note_: World records prior to 12/2/2018 have been omitted due to extremely fast turnover.

The subchapter introduces basic [mechanics](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Objects), including spikes, springs, disappearing platforms, and smashable walls. Red [Strawberries](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Collectibles) also first appear here in both normal and winged form. Traffic light blocks, Forsaken City's signature mechanic, are introduced in this subchapter too. There are no story moments found in this subchapter.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1**Gameplay**](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Forsaken_City)#Gameplay)\n - [1.1Winged Golden Strawberry](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Forsaken_City)#Winged_Golden_Strawberry)\n - [1.2**Strawberries**](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Forsaken_City)#Strawberries)\n- [2**Gallery**](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Forsaken_City)#Gallery)\n\n## **Gameplay**\\[\\]\n\nThere are only 6 screens mandatory to get through in this subchapter, all of which are fairly simple. By dashing diagonally upward, the player can easily make it through these screens. Make sure not to launch Madeline into the spikes in the fourth room by simply not moving while on the traffic light block.\n\n### Winged Golden Strawberry\\[\\]\n\nWhile attempting to do this chapter without dashing to get the Winged Golden Strawberry, the rooms become more challenging. Aside from the second room, the solution is self-explanatory and won't end up very difficult without dashing. In the second room, the jump normally appears impossible as jumping from the height of your climb doesn't make it to the other side of the gap. The trick to doing this room is using the 'spike jump', a tech which allows you to jump from higher than usual. To do this you must reach the top of your climb's height and jump up, then you can jump off the wall as you descend higher than you could from simply jumping while climbing. This barely allows you to bypass the spikes.\n\n### **Strawberries**\\[\\]\n\nThere are 6 Strawberries found in this subchapter (not including the Golden Strawberry which spawns in the first room).\n\nBerry 1\n\nFound in the second room of the subchapter, this is likely the simplest Strawberry you'll get. Bounce off the spring in this room and you can move slightly left and dash directly upward to collect it.\n\nBerry 2\n\nFound in the third room of the subchapter, you can find this Strawberry at the end of the room hovering above some spikes. Run off the platform near it and dash directly upward as soon as you touch the berry, then move to the right and climb up the wall for the safest grab.\n\nBerry 3\n\nFound in the fifth room of the subchapter, this is the first Winged Strawberry of the game. Instead of rushing through this room, you can get to the top without needing to dash with simple jumps and climbing the wall from the right, then walking off the platform.\n\nBerry 4\n\nFound in a hidden room to the left of the sixth room of the subchapter, this is a more complicated Strawberry to collect than the last few. You can either wall jump on the metallic wall or dash directly upward after climbing briefly and jumping. From here, walk on the spring and continue left, then keep yourself inbetween the walls and dash to the right before falling in the spikes to collect the berry.\n\nBerry 5\n\nFound in the sixth room of the subchapter, you must use the momentum from being launched up by the traffic light block and move yourself to the left to grab the floating platform. From there, climb a bit and dash in the direction of the Strawberry.\n\nBerry 6\n\nFound in a hidden room to the right of the sixth room of the subchapter accessed by dashing into the block of ice, this Strawberry can be slightly tricky. You have to fall between the 2 spiked walls and then from there either grab the left wall and jump from there into a diagonal upward dash or dash without needing to touch the wall to land on the traffic light block. After landing, it will take you right to the berry where you can collect it and make it back by simply dashing diagonally through the bridge.\n\n## **Gallery**\\[\\]\n\n| | _Chapters and Subchapters

They unlock each chapter's respective [B-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides#B-Sides). As such, collecting them is required to unlock a chapter's red crystal heart, and all of them must be collected before the C-Sides are unlocked. Cassette Tapes are always in a Cassette Room, featuring [Cassette Blocks](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Block) and an 8-bit remix of the chapter's music. Collecting a Cassette Tape will always lead to Madeline being transported, via bubble, back to the beginning of the room she came from (in [8A](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Core#A-Side) she gets bubbled to the end instead).\n\nAt the level select screen, you can see the checkpoint where the cassette tape (along with strawberries) is found, which can help you locate it.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1Locations of Cassette Tapes](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Locations_of_Cassette_Tapes)\n - [1.1Forsaken City](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Forsaken_City)\n - [1.2Old Site](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Old_Site)\n - [1.3Celestial Resort](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Celestial_Resort)\n - [1.4Golden Ridge](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Golden_Ridge)\n - [1.5Mirror Temple](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Mirror_Temple)\n - [1.6Reflection](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Reflection)\n - [1.7The Summit](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#The_Summit)\n - [1.8Core](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Core)\n- [2Trivia](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#Trivia)\n\n## Locations of Cassette Tapes\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=1) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\n**Thou hast been warned!**\n\nThis section contains spoilers for Celeste.

To find it, go past the zipper on the left to reach an optional area, and then stand on the next zipper and launch yourself upwards. It will take you to a berry room. In the wall to the left is the hole, covered by another zip mover. Grab it to get it out of the way, and the cassette room can be found past the gap in the wall.\n\n### [Old Site](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\nIt's found in the Start checkpoint.

After passing through the touch switch room, the next room has a hidden entrance that can be seen in the top-left corner. Use the second white cloud to reach this height, and run to the left of the berry room which takes you to another hidden area with the tape.\n\n### [Mirror Temple](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Mirror_Temple)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=6) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=6)\\]\n\nThis cassette is found in the Depths checkpoint and can be easily missed if you aren't exploring the entire map. After going past two rooms to the right of where you first encounter [Theo](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Theo) in the mirror, fall off the metal platform and take a red booster to the right. Then, pass the next room and the one after it to get to a room with [strawberry seeds](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Strawberry_seeds). Finally, go through a cracked wall on the right to enter the cassette room.\n\n### [Reflection](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Reflection)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=7) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=7)\\]\n\nIt's found in the Hollows checkpoint, behind a breakable wall on the bottom-left side.

It's easily noticeable, but you must dodge a moving dust bunny that blocks the pathway.\n\n### [Core](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Core)\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=9) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=9)\\]\n\nThe Cassette Tape room is right at the end, and you _must_ collect it to get to the Crystal Heart and complete the chapter.\n\n## Trivia\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?veaction=edit&section=10) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape?action=edit&section=10)\\]\n\n- The original method of obtaining the Cassette Tapes was going to be by collecting several music notes. The player would have to grab multiple of them without touching the ground, similar to how [Strawberry Seeds](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Collectables#Strawberry_Seeds) work in the final game.[\\[1\\]](https://celeste.ink/celeste.ink#cite_note-1)\n- In [Celeste 64](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_64), the cassette tapes don't unlock B-Sides, but upon touching them, the player is transported to a room with a strawberry and Cassette Blocks.\n\n1.

If the player goes behind the [Traffic Light Block](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Traffic_Light_Blocks) in the sub-chapter's first room, then goes two rooms up, and then goes behind the next Conveyor-belt Platform, the Cassette room will become accessible.\n\n## Chapter 2: Old Site\\[\\]\n\nThis Cassette can be found in this chapter's first sub-chapter, \"Start\", but only after the mirror encounter with [Badeline](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Badeline). The player must go down as soon as they enter the large room (the first one where the player has any agency over movement), and must then dash down through the [Dream Block](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Dream_Blocks) in the floor of said room, exposing the Cassette room.\n\n## Chapter 3: Celestial Resort\\[\\]\n\nThis Cassette can be found in this chapter's third sub-chapter, \"Elevator Shaft\", just to the left of the chapter's singular [Key](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Keys) (indicated by the opening through a broken wall with light shining out of it).\n\n## Chapter 4: Golden Ridge\\[\\]\n\nThis chapter's Cassette can be found in this chapter's first sub-chapter, \"Start\". Just after finishing the room that requires the player to collect two [Shields](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Shields) in order to move a [Shield-Activated Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Shield-Activated_Platforms), the player must bounce on the second [White Cloud](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/White_Clouds) from the left, then dash up and left in order to access the top-left corner of the room. The player must then go as far left as possible, passing through the following room (which should contain a number of [Springs](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Springs) and strawberry fragments in order to find this Cassette's room.\n\n## Chapter 5: Mirror Temple\\[\\]\n\nThis Cassette can be found in this chapter's second sub-chapter, \"Depths\". After passing the third [Temple Gate](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Temple_Gates)\u2014the one just after a challenge involving a single [Swap Block](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Swap_Blocks)\u2014the player should head down and to the right in order to find a hidden room leading to a [Red Orb](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Orbs). Taking this orb to the right will lead to a platforming segment; completing this segment and pressing the [Dash Switch](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Dash_Switches) there will open another Temple Gate to the bottom right of this room. Clearing this second room by depressing its Dash Switch will open yet another Temple Gate at the bottom right of this following room, leading to a third, more illuminated room. At the bottom right of this third room, the player can simply walk through a section of cracked wall (with or without completing any associated challenges) to access the Cassette room.\n\n## Chapter 6: Reflection\\[\\]\n\nThis Cassette can be found in the first room of this chapter's third sub-chapter, \"Hollows\". To access the Cassette room, the player must use the nearby [Kevin Block](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Kevin_Blocks) to break the wall below it and send the Block to the bottom of the lake. The player must then quickly attack the Kevin Block again to make it break the wall to its left, exposing the entryway into the Cassette room.\n\n## Chapter 7: The Summit\\[\\]\n\nThis chapter's Cassette can be found in its fourth sub-chapter, \"1500M\". Upon entering this sub-chapter's fifth room, an opening can be seen leading out the top of the room. Entering this opening will lead to the cassette room.\n\n## Chapter 8: Core\\[\\]\n\nThis cassette lies at the end of the chapter and is required to complete it.\n\nCommunity content is available under [CC-BY-SA](https://www.fandom.com/licensing) unless otherwise noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Follow on IG](https://bit.ly/FandomIG) [TikTok](https://bit.ly/TikTokFandom) [Join Fan Lab](https://bit.ly/FanLabWikiBar)"

They exist in every chapter except [Prologue](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Prologue), [Epilogue](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Epilogue) and [Farewell](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell).\n\nIn alternate sides, a remix of the chapter's music is used. These remixes are known as [Celeste B-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_B-Sides), although the exact same soundtrack plays in C-Sides as well.\n\nAlternate sides do not have any [Red Strawberries](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Collectables#Red_Strawberries), but [Golden Strawberries](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Strawberries) can be found and collected there if they have been unlocked and the alternate side has been completed before.\n\nAdditionally, alternate sides of all levels will be instantly unlocked when [Cheat Mode](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cheat_Mode) is enabled in the save file.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1B-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides#B-Sides)\n- [2C-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides#C-Sides)\n- [3Trivia](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides#Trivia)\n- [4References](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides#References)\n\n## B-Sides\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides?veaction=edit&section=1) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Alternate_sides?action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\n[![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/4/4a/Red_crystal_heart_asset.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Red_crystal_heart_asset.png) A Red Crystal Heart\n\nA B-Side for a given chapter can be unlocked by collecting a [Cassette Tape](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape) in the A-Side of the level. It can then be accessed right away, even if the A-Side is not completed yet, and it is possible to unlock the new chapter by completing the B-Side instead. This is commonly used in speedruns to save time, since 5B and 6B are shorter than their A-Side counterparts.\n\nLike A-Sides, B-Sides are segmented into checkpoints.\n\nAt the end of each B-Side is a Cassette Block Room, the only room in the B-Side having [Cassette Blocks](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Blocks), and which ends with a Red [Crystal Heart](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart).

After passing the house, the player must get on the first [Conveyor-Belt Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Conveyor-Belt_Platforms) in the following room and advance to the second as usual; however, on the second Conveyor-Belt Platform, the player must jump left as they're flung into the air and dash upwards to the left of the up sign, revealing a secret passage. The player must then dash to the left from there to get to the room connecting to this screen's top-left corner. After a few screens, the player will arrive at the location of a computer. Here the Crystal Heart puzzle begins.\n\nThe computer will flash a sequence of colors; nearby, there will be a number of small, colored birds, each of whom corresponds with a color that the computer flashes. The computer will flash a series of colors intermittently, followed by the birds all moving in different directions. To obtain the heart, one must pay attention to the sequence of colors that the computer flashes, as well as the directions that the birds move in every time the sequence finishes. The player must dash in the direction that each bird corresponds to in the order in the computer's light sequence where that bird's color appears on the computer (in relation to the other colors, not in real time). The direction sequence that the player must perform is:\n\n[![Celeste Birds](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e7/Celeste_Birds.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20201006071705)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e7/Celeste_Birds.png/revision/latest?cb=20201006071705)\n\nColor Directions\n\n- Up (White)\n- Left (Purple)\n- Down-Right (Blue)\n- Up-Right (Red)\n- Left (Purple)\n- Up-Left (Yellow)\n\nPerforming this series of dashes will cause the birds to form into this chapter's Crystal Heart (entitled _Pointless machines_) which the player can then obtain.\n\n## Chapter 2\\[\\]\n\n[![Resurrections](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/5/5e/Resurrections.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213173921)\n\nResurrections\n\nThe Crystal Heart in this chapter is located in [Chapter 2](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_2)'s first sub-chapter, [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(Old_Site)). In theory, this Crystal Heart should be quite easy to locate, being two screens up from the starting screen of the chapter. In practice, it is very difficult to locate, as there are no [objects](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Objects) that will help one to get there. One of the ways to get there is by exploiting a piece of the game's physics that recharges the player's dash when the player moves from one screen to another. This mechanic is not directly taught in the game (although it is indirectly taught when the player attempts to collect an early strawberry in [Chapter 3](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_3:_Celestial_Resort)), and for this reason, it is regarded by many as one of the hardest Crystal Hearts to find without a guide. The mechanic allows the player to essentially climb thin air by dashing off of the right side of the first screen onto the second screen, then back, repeating until the player moves up to the screen above the first screen. After climbing up a wall from this third screen onto a fourth screen, the player can then fall down onto the third screen, dash onto the fourth screen, and repeat until one\u00a0finds a wall. The player can then climb this wall, after which the player can easily reach the topmost screen, where one can simply walk over to this chapter's Crystal Heart (entitled _Resurrections_) and obtain it.\n\nAnother way to get to this crystal heart is to first get onto the second screen, climb up the wall, stand on the left edge of the platform above the second screen, jump to the far left of the platform and then dash left as soon as the player leaves the screen. By doing so, the player lands on the platform on the left and can then continue climbing up towards the crystal heart.\n\nThe heart can also be seen (but not obtained) in the [Awake](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Awake) subchapter of Chapter 2, where it is easier to locate, and a poem lies near it with hints of how to obtain it:\n\n_An apparition_\n\n_Not of this world_\n\n_But because of it_\n\n_Lurking_ _**out of frame**_\n\n_Awake, my heart is a fortress_\n\n_**In dreams I am vulnerable**_\n\n## Chapter 3\\[\\]\n\n[![Scattered and lost](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/7/7f/Scattered_and_lost.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213174144)\n\nScattered and lost\n\nThe Crystal Heart in [Chapter 3](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_3)\u00a0is located in the second sub-chapter, [Huge Mess](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Huge_Mess). After being tasked to help clean up by Mr. Oshiro, the player must advance to the lower path of the two in the upper right corner. Once the player reaches and activates the large button to clear the purple and white towels, one must\u00a0advance not to the left as usual, but to the right. The player must then travel\u00a0up into the crevice that a stream of water is falling out of to\u00a0reveal a secret path, leading back to one of the earlier rooms of the path. One must then advance upwards and then to the left (in reverse of the way the player first goes through the area) until the player reaches the first room, where the player first runs into Theo in Chapter 3. There is a path at the top of the screen that was previously blocked by towels; the player must dash up to this path and follow it upward to find this chapter's Crystal Heart (entitled _Scattered and lost_) and obtain it.\n\n## Chapter 4\\[\\]\n\n[![Eye of the storm](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e4/Eye_of_the_storm.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213174319)\n\nEye of the storm\n\n[Chapter 4](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_4)'s Crystal Heart is located at the very beginning of the second sub-chapter, [Shrine](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Shrine). To reach the Crystal Heart, the player must cling to the [Guided Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Guided_Platforms), then navigate it left to avoid hitting the wall, after which the player should move it back to the right. Once the player lands, the player must go to the right, into the lit up area. Once one goes into the next room, the player should see a waterfall pouring into a pool of [water](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Water). The player must then swim towards the bottom right corner, and keep swimming to the right until the player reaches a hidden area with a strawberry. The player must then dash into the [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls) to the right to break it, after which the player should reach a tall room. One cannot reach the top normally; the player must crouch on top of the room's idiosyncratic white block until the player disappears. The player is now in the background instead of the foreground, thus allowing one to interact with objects in the background (a trick borrowed from [Super Mario Bros. 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3), which has a similar block with a similar gimmick). This object interaction allows the player to climb to the top of the screen, where the Crystal Heart (entitled _Eye of the storm_) is located.\n\n## Chapter 5\\[\\]\n\n[![Quiet and falling](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e2/Quiet_and_falling.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175216)\n\nQuiet and falling\n\n[Chapter 5](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_5)'s Crystal Heart is located in the second sub-chapter, [Depths](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Depths). After getting the key above the statue, the player must enter the room beneath the statue to the right, then hop on the nearby bubble and travel to the right. Instead of opening the door at the end of the room, the player must enter a second bubble and travel to the left, then dash up into the center of the second platform on their way back. This moves the player into a third bubble that they can use to travel upwards, leading to a secret path above the door. After making their way through the long hallway to reach the next room and going through that room as normal, the player must now head to the bottom of the following room and dash downwards to break the brown [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls) in the floor. This reveals another locked door that they can use the key on, which leads to the Crystal Heart's room. In order to navigate in the room, one must go along the outer edges of the room, using a set of moving blocks and platforms to get to the Crystal Heart (entitled _Quiet and falling_) and obtain it.\n\n## Chapter 6\\[\\]\n\n[![Heavy and frail](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/4/4d/Heavy_and_frail.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175253)\n\nHeavy and frail\n\n[Chapter 6](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_6:_Reflection)'s Crystal Heart is located at the beginning of the third sub-chapter, [Hollows](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Hollows). At the start of the sub-chapter, the player must use the [Angry Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Angry_Platforms) to break through the wall below to get to the first [Feather](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Feathers). One must then use it to fly up-right, and then dash down to break the [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls), revealing the second Feather. The player must use that Feather to fly upwards, then climb to the third Feather, and finally use that Feather to fly to the left of the screen, revealing an entrance to a secret room. After going through the room and breaking another Smashable Wall, the player will see a puzzle with a statue, 6 colored crystals, 4 torches and 3 symbols.\n\n[![Celeste Birds](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/e/e7/Celeste_Birds.png/revision/latest?cb=20201006071705)\n\nBird Color Directions (see Chapter 1)\n\nIn order to solve the puzzle, one must repeat the pattern required to obtain the first chapter's Crystal Heart; doing so correctly will light up the first torch. The same thing must be done for the rest, but with slight alterations for each following torch: the second torch's pattern must be the first, but mirrored left-right (e.g an up-left on the first torch must be an up-right dash for the second); the third torch's pattern has to be mirrored up-down (e.g. an upwards dash on the first must be a downwards dash for the third), and the fourth one's pattern must be mirrored both up-down and left-right (e.g. an up-left dash on the first must be a down-right dash for the fourth). For a complete list of directions, see below:\n\n- First torch: Up, Left, Down-Right, Up-Right, Left, Up-Left\n- Second torch: Up, Right, Down-Left, Up-Left, Right, Up-Right\n- Third torch: Down, Left, Up-Right, Down-Right, Left, Down-Left\n- Fourth torch: Down, Right, Up-Left, Down-Left, Right, Down-Right\n\nAfter lighting up all 4 torches, the Crystal Heart (entitled _Heavy and frail_) will be granted on top of the statue.\n\n## Chapter 7\\[\\]\n\n[![Pink sunrise](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/c/c3/Pink_sunrise.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175701)\n\nPink sunrise\n\nTo obtain the crystal heart in [Chapter 7](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_7), you must find six Jewels hidden in each subchapter\u2014 a blue star for Reflection at the [Start](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Start_(The_Summit)), a sapphire square for Forsaken City at [500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/500_M), an emerald oval for Old Site at [1000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/1000_M), a gold circle for Celestial Resort at [1500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/1500_M), a pink diamond for Golden Ridge at [2000 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2000_M), and a white pearl for Mirror Temple at [2500 M](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/2500_M).

In the following room, just to the right of the second Traffic Light Block, there is a tiny gap in the ground, which the player must fall through to find the room with the second Jewel. Completing the\u00a0spike-lined obstacle course will allow the player to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Emerald\\[\\]\n\nFor 1000 M's Jewel, the player must go through the upper left or upper right route of the 5th screen of the subchapter. If you choose the upper left route, you have to go up through the first [Space Block](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Blocks), then use the Space Block on the right to break a [Smashable Wall](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Smashable_Walls). You will then enter into a room with a strawberry. Going up through the spiked platform will lead you to the path to the Jewel. Going the upper right route will skip the berry. The player must dash to the right in the middle of two Space Blocks to break a Smashable Wall; breaking this wall will reveal another room with [Skull Binoculars](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Skull_Binoculars), as well as with a concealed\u00a0[Disappearing Platform](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Disappearing_Platforms) which the player must stand on to fall to the chamber below. Completing this chamber will allow the player to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Gold\\[\\]\n\n1500 M's Jewel is at the end of the 7th screen of the subchapter and is probably the easiest one to find. Below the exit upwards into the 8th screen, a broken wall can be seen. Going through there and completing the room that it reveals will allow the player to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Diamond\\[\\]\n\n2000 M's Jewel is a trek to get to. To the left of the second room is a seemingly pointless room. In one of the gaps above the player (the widest one above the pit of\u00a0[Crystal Spikes](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_Spikes)), there is a secret platform to stand on, which the player can use to jump all the way to the left of the screen. In the next screen, there is a broken area of the roof, providing another entrance to a secret platform. The player must get there, jump off to the left, dash up to the left, and then dash up as soon as the player is past the wall that they need to climb up. Going up through the hole will reveal the Jewel.\n\n#### Pearl\\[\\]\n\nTo reach 2500 M's Jewel, the player must take the first\u00a0Red Bubble\u00a0left, causing it to break the wall at the left of the first screen. The player must then enter the Red Bubble in the newly revealed screen and take that to the right, causing it to break several more walls before it eventually stops moving. The player must then go up and complete the following screen to obtain this Jewel.\n\n#### Crystal Heart\\[\\]\n\nAt checkpoint 28 at 3000 M, the player must dash under the gap in the wall to the player's right, causing the camera to move and reveal the room with the Crystal Heart. If the player has all of the Jewels, they will pop out of the floor, and the Crystal Heart (entitled _Pink sunrise_) will move to a place where the player can obtain it.\n\n## Chapter 8\\[\\]\n\n[![Heart of the Mountain](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/celestegame/images/1/19/Heart_of_the_Mountain.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190213175751)\n\nHeart of the mountain\n\nThe Crystal Heart in [Chapter 8](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_8) is the most straightforward to obtain, as it is required to obtain at the end of the fourth subchapter, [Heart of the Mountain](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Mountain), to complete the chapter. After getting past all of the chapter's obstacles, the player can complete the level and simultaneously be awarded the Crystal Heart (entitled _Heart of the mountain_).\n\n## Trivia\\[\\]\n\n- The Jewels in [Chapter 7](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_7) appear to be based on the Jewels in the character select screen in TowerFall, matching in both shape and color.\n\nCommunity content is available under [CC-BY-SA](https://www.fandom.com/licensing) unless otherwise noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Fan Feed\n\n- [1Crystal Heart Guide](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_Heart_Guide)\n- [2Chapter 9: Farewell](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_9:_Farewell)\n- [3Madeline](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Madeline)\n\n[Follow on IG](https://bit.ly/FandomIG) [TikTok](https://bit.ly/TikTokFandom) [Join Fan Lab](https://bit.ly/FanLabWikiBar)"

Their primary purpose is to unlock different chapters locked by [Heart Doors](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Heart_Door); thus, they are also a prerequisite to unlocking all [C-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/C-Sides), [Variant Mode](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Variant_Mode), and [Golden Strawberries](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Strawberries). They also serve as chapter completion objectives for all B-Sides, all C-Sides, and [Core A-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Core#A-Side). Blue Crystal Hearts appear in every A-Side, Red Crystal Hearts in every B-Side, Gold Crystal Hearts in every C-Side, and a Gray Crystal Heart in [Farewell](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell), which is revealed to be fake and has cracks. Each Crystal Heart, except the C-Side ones, also has a name specific to itself and an associated [achievement](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Achievements) with said name.\n\nA Crystal Heart can be collected by dashing into it. In [5B](https://celeste.ink/wiki/5B), a crystal heart can also be gathered by throwing a [Theo Crystal](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Theo_Crystal) into it.\n\nAfter a heart is collected, Madeline slows down, and the game continues to run for 135 frames (~2.25 seconds) before she completely stops. It is possible to die during these 135 frames if, for instance, Madeline dashes into spikes. After the collection cutscene depicting the heart in the middle of the screen, the heart is saved and will remain in the save file indefinitely.\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1A-Side Crystal Hearts](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#A-Side_Crystal_Hearts)\n- [2B-Side and C-Side Crystal Hearts](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#B-Side_and_C-Side_Crystal_Hearts)\n- [3Trivia](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#Trivia)\n- [4References](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#References)\n\n## A-Side Crystal Hearts\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?veaction=edit&section=1) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\nCrystal Hearts in A-Sides serve as well-guarded secrets, often hiding at quite a significant distance from the main path or requiring otherwise tedious tasks to be performed. These Crystal Hearts are blue, and each one has a unique name and achievement associated with it.\n\nAn exception to this rule is [Core A-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Core#A-Side): there, it acts the same way as a B-Side or a C-Side heart, being located at the end of the level, and collecting it ends the level. Such hearts also exist within various Celeste [custom maps](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Maps).\n\n[A guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2027298456) is available for anyone struggling with locating the Crystal Hearts. It contains a lot of hints and pointers before giving out the solution, so try it out!\n\n## B-Side and C-Side Crystal Hearts\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?veaction=edit&section=2) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nCrystal Hearts appear at the end of a [Cassette Block](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Block) room in every [B-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/B-Side) in _Celeste_. These Crystal Hearts are red, and each of them also has a unique name and achievement associated with it.\n\nEvery [C-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/C-Side) also contains a Crystal Heart at its end. Unlike the B-Side crystal hearts, these often aren't located at safe locations, and Madeline can die while collecting them. These Crystal Hearts are gold in color, and unlike A and B-Side Crystal hearts, they do not have an associated name or achievement. They also do not appear in the [journal](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Journal).\n\nAll B-Side and C-Side Crystal Hearts double as [golden strawberry](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_strawberry) collection triggers. The \"1000\" that appears when a strawberry is collected appears when the heart cutscene plays and remains on screen until the \"spinning heart\" animation is skipped.\n\n## Trivia\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\n- In early development, only one large heart was meant to exist in the game, and the collectables in each chapter would have been heart shards that would potentially unlock Core. It was changed to what it is now in the release version.[\\[1\\]](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#cite_note-1)\n- Every heart color plays a slightly different pitch of the collection sound.\n- Golden strawberries are saved immediately after dashing into a Crystal Heart in chapters that end with them. Dying after collecting a heart will save the golden strawberry and will respawn the player at the nearest checkpoint instead of at the beginning of the level.\n- The heart names were initially meant to be an experiment with a poem that could have possibly been reassembled in the [journal](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Journal), but the idea was never fulfilled, and realigning the hearts is purely cosmetic.[\\[2\\]](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart#cite_note-2)\n - Most of the current heart names are the same as the names of one of the tracks in the chapter in A- and B-Sides. Namely, the track that the B-Side remixes is the track the A-Side heart is named after, and the B-Side heart is named after the mix's name. The only exceptions to this are 1A, 4A and 7A.\n\n## References\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?veaction=edit&section=4) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart?action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\n1.

This C-Side primarily focuses on quick reflexes with traffic light blocks, which is needed to make it into small corridors surrounded by spikes across the level.\n\n## **Gameplay**\\[\\]\n\nAll three rooms of this level will feature traffic light blocks as the main object to work with. The first room has a cramped maze-like area with spikes covering nearly every side, with the method of getting through being traffic light blocks which will very quickly zip the player across the corridors and potentially right into more spikes if they aren't fast enough to get out. The second room has some falling platforms and lacks a floor for the entirety of the room except the start and the end. The difficulty comes with using traffic light block momentum upwards to make it above the areas while dodging spikes on the ceiling. The final room has a few sections utilizing different aspects of traffic light blocks the player needs to tackle, such as wall jumping on vertical ones or jumping off of horizontally moving ones at the right time.\n\n### **Strategies**\\[\\]\n\nRoom 1\n\nThis first room seems incredibly daunting with spikes all over and seemingly no way to make it through, but the key here is dashing up while holding onto traffic light blocks as they move you to the designated gaps. Jump and grab onto the first traffic light block, then dash straight up as soon as you reach the gap above with the dash crystal. Dash straight right after this, collecting another dash crystal, then grab the left wall. Wall jump to the right and grab the traffic light block, then repeat the process where you dash straight up as you pass under the dash crystal and then dash straight right to claim another and grab the next wall on the left. Jump to the right and grab yet another traffic light block and dash straight up when you pass under the dash crystal it approaches, then move left and grab the other traffic light block nearby. This one will be pushing you against the direction you're going, unlike all the other ones in the room, so make sure to dash a bit earlier than usual to grab the dash crystal as you'll be moving to the right as you dash up. After dashing up, you'll collect another dash crystal and can dash straight right to the end of the room.\n\nRoom 2\n\nThis room has some skull binoculars available to preview the room, if needed. Jump and dash straight right to land on the first falling platform, then quickly jump right and dash straight right again, grabbing the next falling platform. Jump over it to the right to land on one last falling platform, then jump to the right off of this one and dashing right to grab a traffic light block. When this traffic light block is about three-fourths of the way up its travel distance, release the grab button and gently move left to make it up to the area above where you can grab the left wall without bumping into the spikes on the ceiling below. Wall jump to the right, then slide down the right wall until you can grab the right side of the wall below. Jump to the right and wrap around to grab the right side of the next traffic light block, then let go of it after it travels its entire path to be flung all the way to the right and grab one more traffic light block. Release the grab button for this one, again, at three-fourths up its path, then move left a bit to make it up to the ending area of the room.\n\nRoom 3\n\nThis room has some skull binoculars available to preview the room, if needed. All C-Side final rooms will be very long and have plenty of constantly changing challenges to do all in a row. To start off, grab the first traffic light block, then jump over it to the right immediately following that and fall down to the area it travels to, then wall jump off its right side to then grab the traffic light block just to the right. Ride this up to the top of its path and release the grab button, then move right to get over all the spikes and fall back down to then grab its right side. Wait a bit, then wall jump to the right and dash straight up, then move right in the air to be able to land on another traffic light block in the next area. Jump to the right onto another traffic light block quickly, then jump further and dash up to grab the right side of a traffic light block above. This will bring you into a wall of spikes, so jump to the right off of it before it gets close to that point and you'll arrive at a wall to the right. Jump off of it and carefully fall into the hole below, where you'll land on a traffic light block taking you to the left. Stand still and try to dash straight up as you're directly below the sole key token, then grab the wall until the traffic light block starts coming back at which point you can land on it. The key-activated platform will move to the left a bit, so you can jump off of the traffic light block and grab onto the key-activated platform's left side, then climb and jump over it to grab its right side. Jump to the right from the bottom half of the platform while not going too quickly as to not hit the spikes on the wall, then as you pass below this wall's right side you can dash straight up and grab it. Wall jump to the right and grab another traffic light block, jumping at a relatively early point, then fall into the gap below to land on a floor with one more traffic light block to the right. Grab it, climbing up slightly, and release the grab button to be flung straight up, then dash straight right into the Crystal Heart to complete the level.\n\n## **Gallery**\\[\\]\n\n| | _Chapters and

The subchapter just has a few simple sections, and it brings back traffic light blocks and other basic mechanics.\n\n## **Gameplay**\\[\\]\n\nBeing the first B-Side subchapter in the game, this subchapter won't be nearly as difficult as later ones. This subchapter just serves to show the new ways that B-Sides can challenge the player. For example, the second and third rooms will utilize moving traffic light blocks out of the way to get behind them. The fifth room of the subchapter also makes the player do some jumps across a chasm with no dash available.\n\n### **Strategies**\\[\\]\n\nRoom 1\n\nThis room will be reminiscent of the first room in the A-Side, but the approach for it is very different. To get across the pit, you'll need to have your dash by the end of the room. This is accomplished by first climbing up the first wall, then straight up to jump off the wall above to the right. You'll then need to do a wall jump off the right side of both elevated sections on the ground, then after the second one you can do a diagonal up-right dash to make it to the bridge.\n\nRoom 2\n\nFirst, you should hit the climb button against the traffic light block at the beginning of the room to cause it to move up but release it right after. Jump to the wall and hold onto it as you wait for the traffic light block to appear, then when it gets back to its original position, grab its right side. Ride it up, but don't release the climb button until it comes to a complete stop. When it stops, jump to the right and do a wall jump off the left ledge to be able to grab the other traffic light block. Jump over the top of this traffic light block as it starts to move back down and dash to the end section of the room.\n\nRoom 3\n\nIn this room, you'll need to dash straight up after jumping right from the starting section, then grab the wall. Grab onto the traffic light block to make it move up, then jump back to the wall, then jump back right to grab the other traffic light block. Jump over the top of it to fall down to the lower section, then do a wall jump to the other traffic light block and hold onto it until it arrives at the right, where you can then jump up and keep wall jumping to the top.\n\nRoom 4\n\nThis room will just have traffic light blocks on a diagonal path which you'll need to use the momentum of to get over floating platforms full of spikes. For all of the three traffic light blocks, you need to grab the left side, then release the climb button once it reaches the top to get a big vertical boost, then hold right to repeat on the next one until eventually making it to the end where you're free to dash diagonally up-right when the time's right and wall jump up the corridor.\n\nRoom 5\n\nThis room has some skull binoculars available to preview the room, if needed. In this room, you'll need to wall jump and then dash upward to grab onto the right side of the traffic light block, then when it reaches the right side, you must release the button and hold right to be boosted far to the right and arrive at the next section. From the floating platform section you arrive at, jump to the left and grab the right side of the closer tiny platform. Jump above the platform and continue left to grab the other tiny platform. Jump from there back right and do a wall jump off of the first floating platform's left side. This will allow you to easily get over to the left side of the further floating platform, and after that you can jump to the area above and collect the dash crystal. You can then go right from that area and dash diagonally up-right over the cluster of spikes and arrive at the end.\n\n## **Gallery**\\[\\]\n\n| | _Chapters and Subchapters in Celeste_ |\n| --- |\n|

As Madeline continues to climb Forsaken City, which is filled with [traffic-light blocks](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Zippers) and city decor, she finds Theo and meets him for the first time. Theo presents himself in a much more flamboyant way, being in awe because of the city; he rejoices because of Madeline's presence. Her silence scares him to some degree, to the point where he calls Madeline a \"lone wolf type\" before even knowing her name. Madeline subsequently introduces herself and states that she has \"a lot on her mind\". Theo reacts positively, saying that she couldn't have \"come to a better place\". She then asks where he comes from: Theo apparently lives in Seattle. Madeline then talks about what she knows about the city itself. After Madeline asks Theo why he is climbing Mount Celeste, he answers that he \"has a thing for abandoned places\", and also considers himself a budding photographer, often posting online via [InstaPix](https://celeste.ink/wiki/InstaPix) (a parody of Instagram). Madeline then states that she is heading for the summit, which directly ends up telling Theo about her determination. Theo, on the other hand, mainly wants to explore the ruins around the mountain. He knows that he is doing something irresponsible but then suppresses his \"holding-back\" instinct, saying \"YOLOOOOOOOOO!!\" Madeline then continues up the mountain, without Theo (for the moment), until she reaches the Celeste Mountain Memorial dedicated to those who perished on the climb (towards the [summit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/The_Summit)). Right beside, seeing an unlit campfire and realizing how tired she is, she lights it up, puts down her backpack, and goes to sleep. The [Bird](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Bird) reappears, landing on her head. Madeline then contemplates whether her decision to climb the mountain was a mistake. |\n\n## Gameplay\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=2) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\n### A-Side\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\n| Forsaken City\u00a0A-Side |\n| --- |\n| [![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/d/d1/Celeste_1_9b.png/510px-Celeste_1_9b.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/File:Celeste_1_9b.png) |\n| |\n| Level | 1A |\n| Strawberries | [![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/a/a1/Strawberry_ingame.png/28px-Strawberry_ingame.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Strawberry)**20** \u00a0\u2022 [![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/1/17/Goldberry_ingame.png/36px-Goldberry_ingame.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Strawberries) 1 \u00a0\u2022 [![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/f/f0/WingedGoldberry_ingame.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Winged_Gold_Berry) 1 |\n| Soundtrack | [Celeste OST](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_OST): _02 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0First Steps_ [Madeline's Grab Bag](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Madeline%27s_Grab_Bag): _09 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0First Steps (Piano Only)_ |\n\n| |\n| --- |\n| **Forsaken City** [A-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1A) \u00a0\u2022 [B-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1B) \u00a0\u2022 [C-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1C) |\n\nForsaken City's A-Side serves as an introductory level to much of how the game works. Madeline, controlled by the player, is introduced to combining jumping, dashing, and climbing to make it through various rooms while avoiding spikes and bottomless pits. Strawberries, [cassette tapes](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_tape), [crystal hearts](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_heart), dash-refilling crystals, and many other [entities](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Entities) are all introduced here.\n\nThree subchapters are present: Start, Crossing, and Chasm.\n\n#### Start\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=4) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\nThe beginning of the Start checkpoint introduces the player to several basic mechanics with dashes. The second room introduces [springs](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Springs) wall jumping, which occurs when Madeline jumps from one wall to another; it is the simplest way to climb without using [stamina](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Stamina).\n\n[Zippers](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Zippers), also known as traffic light blocks, first appear in the fourth room. Jumping too soon while the block is moving will result in Madeline being thrown into a wall of spikes; this is the player's first introduction to momentum. The next room features a [winged strawberry](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Collectables#Winged_Red_Strawberries); dashing will result in it flying away, and as such, Madeline must jump on the crumble blocks (also introduced here) to the right of the berry to collect it. The following room features a light shining at the left, which leads to the first occurrence of a \"berry room\", a room outside the main path containing a strawberry.\n\n[Springs](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Spring), which bounce Madeline in the direction the spring is pointing towards, and [smashable walls](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Smashable_walls), which may be dashed into to remove, are also introduced here. Six strawberries are hidden within this subchapter.\n\n#### Crossing\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=5) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=5)\\]\n\nAt the beginning of this subchapter, you can take the path left and use the [dash refill](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Dash_refill) to dash left twice. The left path leads to [Theo](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Theo), and the top path leads to another berry room. In the second room of the main path, a background building (named `brazilian_coffee_building`) can be noticed.\n\nLater during this subchapter, falling ice blocks reappear. 9 strawberries are hidden in this subchapter, and so is the [Crystal Heart](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables#Crystal_Heart).\n\n#### Chasm\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=6) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=6)\\]\n\nThe final subchapter contains several more intricate uses of zippers. A [Cassette Tape](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables#Cassette_Tape), which unlocks the B-Side, can be found here.\n\nFive strawberries are hidden within this subchapter.\n\n### B-Side\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=7) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=7)\\]\n\n| Forsaken City\u00a0B-Side |\n| --- |\n| |\n| Level | 1B |\n| Strawberries | [![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/1/17/Goldberry_ingame.png/36px-Goldberry_ingame.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Strawberries) 1 |\n| Soundtrack | [Celeste B-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_B-Sides): _01 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0First Steps (Sever the Skyline Mix)_ _Remixed by Maxo_ |\n\nForsaken City's B-Side builds upon the mechanics of the A-Side, presenting them in a more challenging way. No new entities are introduced in this chapter, but [Binoculars](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Binoculars), present in later chapters, also appear. Zipper blocks no longer generally follow an octadirectional system, and now appear much more frequently, often with spikes on them. Spikes are placed much more liberally and are often integrated with momentum-based rooms. Also, the game introduces resource management as a key factor, as many rooms in the B-Side force the player to conserve stamina, dashes, or both to get to the exit.\n\nThe level follows approximately the same course as the A-Side, but is slightly shorter, heading both upwards and right. It continues slightly past the Celeste Mountain Memorial and unlit campfire into a [Cassette Block](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Block) room. The red crystal heart, situated at the end of the room, is named \"Sever the Skyline\".\n\nThree sub-chapters are present: Start, Contraption, and Scrap Pit.\n\n### C-Side\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=8) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=8)\\]\n\n| Forsaken City\u00a0C-Side |\n| --- |\n| |\n| Level | 1C |\n| Strawberries | [![](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/1/17/Goldberry_ingame.png/36px-Goldberry_ingame.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Strawberries) 1 |\n| Soundtrack | [Celeste B-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_B-Sides): _01 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0First Steps (Sever the Skyline Mix)_ _Remixed by Maxo_ |\n\n| |\n| --- |\n| **Forsaken City** [A-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1A) \u00a0\u2022 [B-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1B) \u00a0\u2022 [C-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1C) |\n\nForsaken City's C-Side further builds upon mechanics introduced in Forsaken City's A-Side and B-Side. The three-room gauntlet, unlocked after completing [Core B-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/8B), adds [Touch switches](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Touch_switches) and touch switch gates. It further enhances the difficulty and adds the idea of dashing away from a traffic block to _not_ gain momentum.\n\n## Strawberries & Collectables\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=9) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=9)\\]\n\nMain article: [Forsaken City Collectables](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables)\n\nForsaken City contains 20 unique red strawberries hidden throughout the chapter. This includes 2 winged strawberries. Additionally, a [Cassette Tape](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape) and Blue [Crystal Heart](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart) are hidden within.\n\n### Winged Golden Strawberry\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=10) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=10)\\]\n\nMain article: [Winged Golden Strawberry](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Winged_Gold_Berry)\n\nA unique collectable, the _Winged Golden Strawberry_, only appears in Forsaken City's A-Side. Obtaining it requires not completing any rooms within the entire chapter using Madeline's dash move; this entails the use of several advanced [tech](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Tech), such as [neutral jumping](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Neutrals), and nearly pixel-perfect precision on several occasions.\n\nThe player can dash by accident so long as they die before moving to the next room, collecting a strawberry, or activating a change respawn trigger.\n\n## Speedrun strategies\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=11) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=11)\\]\n\nApart from general movement optimization, speedrunners use various tech such as wallbouncing in the first winged berry room (with the breaking blocks) and doing a reverse [hyperdash](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Hyperdashes) off the girder to do a corner boost off a wall which leads to the room with Theo. Screen transitions are used to refill dashes, allowing to skip doing the main path. Doing [neutral jumps](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Neutral_jumps) in the final room as well as a corner kick-up enables players to literally skip the whole room. These tricks allow speedrunners to do this chapter extremely quickly.\n\n**Celeste base game chapters**\n\n- [![Prologue](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/2/2f/PrologueAndEpilogueIcon.png/150px-PrologueAndEpilogueIcon.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Prologue)\n\n[Prologue](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Prologue)\n\n- [![Forsaken City](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/1/16/ForsakenCityIcon.png/150px-ForsakenCityIcon.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City)\n\nForsaken City\n\n- [![Old Site](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/d/dc/OldSiteIcon.png/150px-OldSiteIcon.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site)\n\n[Old Site](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site)\n\n- [![Celestial Resort](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/4/45/CelestialResortIcon.png/150px-CelestialResortIcon.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort)\n\n[Celestial Resort](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort)\n\n- [![Golden Ridge](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/7/75/GoldenRidgeIcon.png/150px-GoldenRidgeIcon.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Ridge)\n\n[Golden Ridge](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Ridge)\n\n- [![Mirror Temple](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/5/57/MirrorTempleIcon.png/125px-MirrorTempleIcon.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Mirror_Temple)\n\n[Mirror Temple](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Mirror_Temple)\n\n- [![Reflection](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/1/16/ReflectionIcon.png/150px-ReflectionIcon.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Reflection)\n\n[Reflection](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Reflection)\n\n- [![The Summit](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/7/71/SummitIcon.png/150px-SummitIcon.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/The_Summit)\n\n[The Summit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/The_Summit)\n\n- [![Epilogue](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/2/2f/PrologueAndEpilogueIcon.png/150px-PrologueAndEpilogueIcon.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Epilogue)\n\n[Epilogue](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Epilogue)\n\n- [![Core](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/8/81/CoreIcon.png/150px-CoreIcon.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Core)\n\n[Core](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Core)\n\n- [![Farewell](https://static.wikitide.net/celestewiki/thumb/c/c0/FarewellIcon.png/150px-FarewellIcon.png)](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell)\n\n[Farewell](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell)\n\n\nRetrieved from \" [https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken\\_City?oldid=8958](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?oldid=8958)\"\n\n[Categories](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Special:Categories):\n\n- [Forsaken City](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Category:Forsaken_City)\n- [Main chapter articles](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Category:Main_chapter_articles)\n\nCookies help us deliver our services.
