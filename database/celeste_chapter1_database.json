Use the crystals to make it to the far wall, wait for them to regenerate and then return safely to the right side of the screen with the fruit. ### Strawberry \\#11 In the same room as Strawberry #10, climb the right-hand wall to reach the sole platform. Jump out into the middle and dash upward to find a new screen. Climb through this room, using the falling blocks and the geared platform to make it to the top. In the following room, you’ll spot the strawberry. Dash and climb your way to the brown platform. Drop down to the strawberry and dash in between the spikes to collect the green crystal. With your dash restored, dash diagonally upward to safety. ### Strawberry \\#12 Advance a few couple more rooms until you reach the room with the floating column topped with spikes in the center. Before leaving the room by going to the right, there are two other rooms that house strawberries. One of them is at the top and the other is at the bottom.
