As Madeline continues to climb Forsaken City, which is filled with [traffic-light blocks](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Zippers) and city decor, she finds Theo and meets him for the first time. Theo presents himself in a much more flamboyant way, being in awe because of the city; he rejoices because of Madeline's presence. Her silence scares him to some degree, to the point where he calls Madeline a \"lone wolf type\" before even knowing her name. Madeline subsequently introduces herself and states that she has \"a lot on her mind\". Theo reacts positively, saying that she couldn't have \"come to a better place\". She then asks where he comes from: Theo apparently lives in Seattle. Madeline then talks about what she knows about the city itself. After Madeline asks Theo why he is climbing Mount Celeste, he answers that he \"has a thing for abandoned places\", and also considers himself a budding photographer, often posting online via [InstaPix](https://celeste.ink/wiki/InstaPix) (a parody of Instagram). Madeline then states that she is heading for the summit, which directly ends up telling Theo about her determination. Theo, on the other hand, mainly wants to explore the ruins around the mountain. He knows that he is doing something irresponsible but then suppresses his \"holding-back\" instinct, saying \"YOLOOOOOOOOO!!\" Madeline then continues up the mountain, without Theo (for the moment), until she reaches the Celeste Mountain Memorial dedicated to those who perished on the climb (towards the [summit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/The_Summit)). Right beside, seeing an unlit campfire and realizing how tired she is, she lights it up, puts down her backpack, and goes to sleep. The [Bird](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Bird) reappears, landing on her head. Madeline then contemplates whether her decision to climb the mountain was a mistake. |\n\n## Gameplay\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=2) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\n### A-Side\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=3) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\n| Forsaken City\u00a0A-Side |\n| --- |\n| Level | 1A |\n| Strawberries | **20** \u00a0\u2022 1 \u00a0\u2022 1 |\n| Soundtrack | [Celeste OST](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_OST): _02 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0First Steps_ [Madeline's Grab Bag](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Madeline%27s_Grab_Bag): _09 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0First Steps (Piano Only)_ |\n\n| |\n| --- |\n| **Forsaken City** [A-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1A) \u00a0\u2022 [B-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1B) \u00a0\u2022 [C-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1C) |\n\nForsaken City's A-Side serves as an introductory level to much of how the game works. Madeline, controlled by the player, is introduced to combining jumping, dashing, and climbing to make it through various rooms while avoiding spikes and bottomless pits. Strawberries, [cassette tapes](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_tape), [crystal hearts](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_heart), dash-refilling crystals, and many other [entities](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Entities) are all introduced here.\n\nThree subchapters are present: Start, Crossing, and Chasm.\n\n#### Start\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=4) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\nThe beginning of the Start checkpoint introduces the player to several basic mechanics with dashes. The second room introduces [springs](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Springs) wall jumping, which occurs when Madeline jumps from one wall to another; it is the simplest way to climb without using [stamina](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Stamina).\n\n[Zippers](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Zippers), also known as traffic light blocks, first appear in the fourth room. Jumping too soon while the block is moving will result in Madeline being thrown into a wall of spikes; this is the player's first introduction to momentum. The next room features a [winged strawberry](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Collectables#Winged_Red_Strawberries); dashing will result in it flying away, and as such, Madeline must jump on the crumble blocks (also introduced here) to the right of the berry to collect it. The following room features a light shining at the left, which leads to the first occurrence of a \"berry room\", a room outside the main path containing a strawberry.\n\n[Springs](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Spring), which bounce Madeline in the direction the spring is pointing towards, and [smashable walls](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Smashable_walls), which may be dashed into to remove, are also introduced here. Six strawberries are hidden within this subchapter.\n\n#### Crossing\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=5) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=5)\\]\n\nAt the beginning of this subchapter, you can take the path left and use the [dash refill](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Dash_refill) to dash left twice. The left path leads to [Theo](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Theo), and the top path leads to another berry room. In the second room of the main path, a background building (named `brazilian_coffee_building`) can be noticed.\n\nLater during this subchapter, falling ice blocks reappear. 9 strawberries are hidden in this subchapter, and so is the [Crystal Heart](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables#Crystal_Heart).\n\n#### Chasm\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=6) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=6)\\]\n\nThe final subchapter contains several more intricate uses of zippers. A [Cassette Tape](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables#Cassette_Tape), which unlocks the B-Side, can be found here.\n\nFive strawberries are hidden within this subchapter.\n\n### B-Side\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=7) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=7)\\]\n\n| Forsaken City\u00a0B-Side |\n| --- |\n| Level | 1B |\n| Strawberries | 1 |\n| Soundtrack | [Celeste B-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_B-Sides): _01 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0First Steps (Sever the Skyline Mix)_ _Remixed by Maxo_ |\n\nForsaken City's B-Side builds upon the mechanics of the A-Side, presenting them in a more challenging way. No new entities are introduced in this chapter, but [Binoculars](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Binoculars), present in later chapters, also appear. Zipper blocks no longer generally follow an octadirectional system, and now appear much more frequently, often with spikes on them. Spikes are placed much more liberally and are often integrated with momentum-based rooms. Also, the game introduces resource management as a key factor, as many rooms in the B-Side force the player to conserve stamina, dashes, or both to get to the exit.\n\nThe level follows approximately the same course as the A-Side, but is slightly shorter, heading both upwards and right. It continues slightly past the Celeste Mountain Memorial and unlit campfire into a [Cassette Block](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Block) room. The red crystal heart, situated at the end of the room, is named \"Sever the Skyline\".\n\nThree sub-chapters are present: Start, Contraption, and Scrap Pit.\n\n### C-Side\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=8) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=8)\\]\n\n| Forsaken City\u00a0C-Side |\n| --- |\n| Level | 1C |\n| Strawberries | 1 |\n| Soundtrack | [Celeste B-Sides](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celeste_B-Sides): _01 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0First Steps (Sever the Skyline Mix)_ _Remixed by Maxo_ |\n\n| |\n| --- |\n| **Forsaken City** [A-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1A) \u00a0\u2022 [B-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1B) \u00a0\u2022 [C-side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/1C) |\n\nForsaken City's C-Side further builds upon mechanics introduced in Forsaken City's A-Side and B-Side. The three-room gauntlet, unlocked after completing [Core B-Side](https://celeste.ink/wiki/8B), adds [Touch switches](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Touch_switches) and touch switch gates. It further enhances the difficulty and adds the idea of dashing away from a traffic block to _not_ gain momentum.\n\n## Strawberries & Collectables\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=9) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=9)\\]\n\nMain article: [Forsaken City Collectables](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Collectables)\n\nForsaken City contains 20 unique red strawberries hidden throughout the chapter. This includes 2 winged strawberries. Additionally, a [Cassette Tape](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Cassette_Tape) and a Blue [Crystal Heart](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Crystal_Heart) are hidden within.\n\n### Winged Golden Strawberry\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=10) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=10)\\]\n\nMain article: [Winged Golden Strawberry](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City/Winged_Gold_Berry)\n\nA unique collectable, the _Winged Golden Strawberry_, only appears in Forsaken City's A-Side. Obtaining it requires not completing any rooms within the entire chapter using Madeline's dash move; this entails the use of several advanced [tech](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Tech), such as [neutral jumping](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Neutrals), and nearly pixel-perfect precision on several occasions.\n\nThe player can dash by accident so long as they die before moving to the next room, collecting a strawberry, or activating a change respawn trigger.\n\n## Speedrun strategies\n\n\\[ [edit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?veaction=edit&section=11) \\| [edit source](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?action=edit&section=11)\\]\n\nApart from general movement optimization, speedrunners use various tech such as wallbouncing in the first winged berry room (with the breaking blocks) and doing a reverse [hyperdash](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Hyperdashes) off the girder to do a corner boost off a wall which leads to the room with Theo. Screen transitions are used to refill dashes, allowing to skip doing the main path. Doing [neutral jumps](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Neutral_jumps) in the final room as well as a corner kick-up enables players to literally skip the whole room. These tricks allow speedrunners to do this chapter extremely quickly.\n\n**Celeste base game chapters**\n\n- [Prologue](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Prologue)\n\n- Forsaken City\n\n- [Old Site](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Old_Site)\n\n- [Celestial Resort](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Celestial_Resort)\n\n- [Golden Ridge](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Golden_Ridge)\n\n- [Mirror Temple](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Mirror_Temple)\n\n- [Reflection](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Reflection)\n\n- [The Summit](https://celeste.ink/wiki/The_Summit)\n\n- [Epilogue](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Epilogue)\n\n- [Core](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Core)\n\n- [Farewell](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Farewell)\n\n\nRetrieved from \" [https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken\\_City?oldid=11981](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Forsaken_City?oldid=11981)\"\n\n[Categories](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Special:Categories):\n\n- [Forsaken City](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Category:Forsaken_City)\n- [Main chapter articles](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Category:Main_chapter_articles)\n\nCookies help us deliver our services.

In order to complete this challenge, players need to abuse the game's lenient hitboxes and \"coyote frames\" in order to perform very tight and difficult jumps. The player also has to learn a technique called \"neutral jumping\", which will be needed in a few sections towards the end. If the player manages to complete the chapter without dashing even once, a flying Golden Strawberry will appear on the last screen.\n\nUnlike all other Golden Strawberries, the player doesn't have to complete this chapter without dying in order to get it.\n\n## **Plot**\\[\\]\n\n**I tried to warn you.**\n\nThis section contains spoilers for Chapter 1: Forsaken City. Do not read the following section if you wish to avoid spoilers for Chapter 1: Forsaken City.\n\n[Madeline](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Madeline) travels through the titular Forsaken City, finding another hiker, Theo, about halfway through the level. Madeline and Theo converse, and Theo explains that he came to Celeste Mountain to explore and to take pictures, although Madeline avoids explaining why she came to Celeste Mountain. The two also discuss the origins of the Forsaken City, with Madeline explaining that a mega-corporation started building the city, but nobody wanted to live there, although neither of them know why. Madeline also expresses a desire to reach the summit of Celeste Mountain, something that Theo does not seem as interested in doing. Eventually, Madeline returns to climbing Celeste Mountain. At the end of the level, she encounters a memorial (entitled the Celeste Memorial), decides to stop there and make camp for the night, and goes to sleep, thinking that climbing Celeste Mountain might have been a mistake.\n\n**Show/Hide Content**\n\n## **Speedrunning Record Progression**\\[\\]\n\nOn 27 November 2018, Buhbai achieved 1:30 in City B, obtaining the first ever full sweep of a level.\n\nClear (1A):\n\n| Name | Time | Date | Days Standing |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Forsaken | 1:04.770 | 12/2/2018 | 11 |\n| Forsaken | 1:04.107 | 23/2/2018 | 12 |\n| Forsaken | 1:03.614 | 7/3/2018 | 62 |\n| DemoJameson | 1:02.662 | 8/5/2018 | 4 |\n| McBoi | 1:02.288 | 12/5/2018 | 14 |\n| McBoi | 1:02.135 | 26/5/2018 | 4 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:01.897 | 30/5/2018 | 8 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:01.166 | 7/6/2018 | 1 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:00.588 | 8/6/2018 | 5 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:00.095 | 13/6/2018 | 28 |\n| Hornlitz | 59.867 | 11/7/2018 | 81 |\n| Jumpyluff | 59.755 | 30/9/2018 | 6 |\n| Buhbai | 59.262 | 6/10/2018 | 147 |\n| UltraMarlin | 58.871 | 2/3/2019 | 17 |\n| FPlush | 58.514 | 19/3/2019 | 14 |\n| Zkad | 58.242 | 2/4/2019 | 9 |\n| Zkad | 58.089 | 11/4/2019 | 4 |\n| Zkad | 57.987 | 15/4/2019 | 30 |\n| FPlush | 57.868 | 15/5/2019 | 1 |\n| Zkad | 57.460 | 16/5/2019 | 23 |\n| FPlush | 57.103 | 8/6/2019 | 17 |\n| Zkad | 56.678 | 25/6/2019 | 99 |\n| Zkad | 56.644 | 2/10/2019 | 3 |\n| Zkad | 56.457 | 5/10/2019 | 4 |\n| Zkad | 56.151 | 9/10/2019 | 5 |\n| **Zkad** | **55.998** | **14/10/2019** | **127+** |\n| UltraMarlin\\* | 58.140 | 26/6/2019 | 0 |\n\n_Note_: World records prior to 12/2/2018 have been omitted due to extremely fast turnover.

It teaches you the basics of maneuvering and maintaining enough stamina, wile using the environment to the best of your ability. It also happens to be a dense level, packed with collectibles and secret rooms.\n\nBelow is a list of all 20 strawberries for this level, as well as the locations for the cassette tape and the Crystal Heart.\n\n## Start\n\n### Strawberry \\#1\n\nThe first strawberry is right out in the open on the second screen of the chapter. Use the spring to gain height and dash into the strawberry. Touch the ground to lock it in!\n\n### Strawberry \\#2\n\nOn the screen immediately after the first strawberry is the second! Drop down from the platform above the fruit to grab it and dash into the wall to recover. Climb and wall jump back up to safety!\n\n### Strawberry \\#3\n\nThis strawberry is the first flying strawberry you see. You cannot dash on this screen or you\u2019ll scare it away. Use the platforms on the right to get above the flying fruit and drop down to collect it.\n\n### Strawberry \\#4\n\nThe screen above the flying strawberry, go to the room on the left with the glowing light first. Jump and dash upward to make it to the landing in the middle. You can grab the wall if you need to climb up. Using the spring, hop over the spikes and fall gracefully downward, using your dash to collect the strawberry and land safely.\n\n### Strawberry \\#5\n\nThe screen above the flying strawberry, use the lift on the right to fling yourself up and to the left. Use your dash to grab the strawberry in the upper left corner.\n\n### Strawberry \\#6\n\nIn the same room as Strawberry #5 is a breakable block in the lower right corner. Dash through it to find the sixth strawberry\u2019s location. Drop through the spikes and dash to the geared platform. Ride it and jump off toward the strawberry. Catch a ride back and dash through the floor above to safely clear the room.\n\n## Crossing\n\n### Strawberry \\#7\n\nThis strawberry is in a room above the character Theo. To find Theo, go left from the room with a green crystal in the center. Jump and dash diagonally to the left to hit the green crystal in this new room and dash again to make it to safe ground. Climb up the wall on the left to find a hidden area.\n\nWatch out for the spring on the ground beneath the spikes! Hop over the hazard and use the second spring to launch toward the wall. Grab it and jump over the spikes toward the green crystal. Dash toward safety and the strawberry. Drop down the passage on the left to see Theo.\n\n### Strawberry \\#8\n\nBack in the room with the green crystal in the center (Reference photo above in Strawberry #7), make your way to the right. Climb up and dash above the crystal so you fall on it to regain your dash. Before hitting the spikes, dash to the right on safe ground. Instead of jumping up, dash through the brown rock to find a hidden strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#9\n\nIn the room with the two geared platforms (one that launches you to the right, the other upward), there is a secret passage that leads to the upper left corner. Using the upward geared platform, jump and dash into the small crevice next to the up arrow sign. This reveals the passage to the left corner.\n\nTo clear this room, you need to overcome two geared platform obstacles. Wall jump to reach the top of the first, grab on to activate it and then quickly let go and dash over the spikes. Grab the second block and ride it all the way to the left. Climb in the small alcove above and let the platform pass beneath you. Climb onto the left side of the block and ride it back over. Wall jump your way out and go left.\n\nDash through the air onto the only platforms until you reach the satellite where the strawberry is.\n\n### Crystal Heart\n\nStick around at the satellite to find Chapter 1\u2019s Crystal Heart. The birds are the key to this puzzle. After the computer beeps through a cycle, the birds strike a pose. Each color goes to the same spot. These locations are actually directions to dash in and the computer cycle is the order in which you need to dash.\n\nThe solution is Up, Left, Down-Right, Up-Right, Left, Up-Left. Dash in those directions and the Crystal Heart will appear.\n\n### Strawberry \\#10\n\nContinuing to go to the right, after the room with the secret passage in the center, hop on the spring and break the block in the upper left corner. Inside is a room with two green crystals, a spiked floor, Strawberry #10, AND the passage to the next collectible piece of fruit.\n\nUse the crystals to make it to the far wall, wait for them to regenerate and then return safely to the right side of the screen with the fruit.\n\n### Strawberry \\#11\n\nIn the same room as Strawberry #10, climb the right-hand wall to reach the sole platform. Jump out into the middle and dash upward to find a new screen.\n\nClimb through this room, using the falling blocks and the geared platform to make it to the top. In the following room, you\u2019ll spot the strawberry. Dash and climb your way to the brown platform. Drop down to the strawberry and dash in between the spikes to collect the green crystal. With your dash restored, dash diagonally upward to safety.\n\n### Strawberry \\#12\n\nAdvance a few couple more rooms until you reach the room with the floating column topped with spikes in the center.\n\nBefore leaving the room by going to the right, there are two other rooms that house strawberries. One of them is at the top and the other is at the bottom.\n\nUsing the column in the center, climb up to the platform in the left corner to regain your dash. Hop to the right side of the column and then leap to the disappearing block platform. Jump straight up to the small wooden ledge and climb into the room above.\n\nUse the geared platforms to go around the room and get the strawberry. Be careful to not jump off of the first platform too soon or the momentum will carry you into the spikes above. When on the horizontal-moving platform, use its momentum to leap down to the strawberry, dashing to clear the spikes on the ground.\n\n### Strawberry \\#13\n\nBack in the center room, you can see a small path on the floor that drops into a room below. You need to drop down above the spikes and then dash into the small path.\n\nIn the room below, you simply need to hop across all three geared platforms to grab the strawberry at the end. Hold onto the wall until they reset and then hop your way back to safety.\n\n### Strawberry \\#14\n\nThis strawberry is out in the open, in between walls of spikes at the top of the screen. Use the momentum of the upward moving geared platforms in the room to launch close to the fruit and then dash upward to nab it. Be careful to not dash too high up or you\u2019ll hit the spikes. Continue out of the room to lock in the strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#15\n\nThis strawberry requires you to be quick with your wall jumps. Out in the open as well, ride the geared platform on its left side. At the end, climb up to safety and recharge your stamina. Drop down and dash to the left to grab onto the geared platform, this time on its right-hand side. When it stops, jump off to grab the strawberry and then quickly wall jump back. Jump up to solid ground and lock in the fruit.\n\n## Chasm\n\n### Strawberry \\#16\n\nTo find the next couple of strawberries, you\u2019ll need to get behind the geared platform in the open room. Grab onto it, ride it to a stop, then hop and dash over it to slip behind it into this new area.\n\nSkip over the geared platform in the floor and continue to the left. In the next room, use the blade of grass as a marker for how long your dash is. Dash to the spring on the floor and use its lift to safely dash to the wooden platform above. Drop down to the ledge with the green sign and then climb out of this room.\n\nOutside is the strawberry. Drop down to get it and then climb back up the wall to get to solid ground.\n\n### Cassette Tape\n\nBack in the room with the geared platform in the floor, use its upward momentum to fling you to the ground above. Head into the next room to find a geared platform in the wall. Before using it to get the tantalizing strawberry on the right, activate it and sneak into the room behind it that is emitting a glow.\n\nThis is a cassette tape room. The blue and pink platforms alternate based off the beat of the music. Time your jumps to navigate the room on the alternating platforms to grab the tape. This unlocks Chapter 1\u2019s B Side level.\n\n### Strawberry \\#17\n\nBack in the room with the geared platform in the floor, use its upward momentum to fling you to the ground above. Head into the next room to see your next strawberry. After getting the Cassette Tape, use the geared platform to fling yourself across the room to the strawberry.\n\n### Strawberry \\#18\n\nThis strawberry is clear as day in the chasm room. Use the geared platform to launch yourself across the room. When beneath the strawberry\u2019s location, dash up to snag it.\n\n### Strawberry \\#19\n\nAfter snagging Strawberry #18, hop through the floor and go to the right. This room contains another flying strawberry. Use the geared platofrm to launch across the room to the disappearing blocks. Climb the right-hand wall up to the spring and grab the flying fruit.\n\n### Strawberry \\#20\n\nIn the spike room with the blocks that fall when you grab them will be the hiding spot for this strawberry.\n\nThe block in the upper left corner will drop down if you grab it. Drop the block and then dash into the wall that was behind it to reveal a hidden path.\n\nThe next screen reveals the strawberry. Use the green crystals to make your way up and around the spikes, grabbing the strawberry along the way.\n\n### Up Next: Chapter 2- Old Site\n\n[Previous\\\n\\\nWalkthrough](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Walkthrough) [Next\\\n\\\nChapter 2- Old Site](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Chapter_2-_Old_Site)\n\n### Top Guide Sections\n\n- [Walkthrough](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Walkthrough)\n- [Tips and Tricks](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Tips_and_Tricks)\n- [Strawberries](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Strawberries)\n- [Cassette Tapes](https://www.ign.com/wikis/celeste/Cassette_Tapes)\n\n### Was this guide helpful?\n\nLeave feedback\n\n### In This Guide\n\n[Celeste](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\n[Matt Makes Games Inc.](https://www.ign.com/games/producer/matt-makes-games-inc) Jan 25, 2018\n\n+2\n\n[Learn more](https://www.ign.com/games/celeste)\n\nGo to comments",

So for clarification, in this guide sometimes I will say: 'Do [x] to grab the strawberry' and 'Do [x] to collect the strawberry' Grabbed Grabbing a strawberry will make it float near you. It is NOT collected and will return to it's original location if you die. \u200e Collected A strawberry will be collected once you touch the ground for a short amount of time. When you collect a strawberry it will disappear with a flash showing '1000' (like\u200e arcade\u200e points) and will also add to your strawberry total in the top left of the screen.\u200e \n \n \n \n \n Chapter Mechanics \n \n [Core] - Traffic-Light Lift \u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594 [Other names: Conveyor-Belt Platforms, Zippers, Traffic Light Blocks] The core mechanic in chapter 1 is the traffic light lifts. If you jump as it lifts up, they allow you to boost to locations you wouldn't have been able to reach otherwise - this also applies to lifts that move horizontally and if you are grabbing onto the side. However, to achieve the maximum boost, also known as the hyper-dash - you have to perfect your timing, and hold down the jump button for a good 1 second (not just a quick press and release) Below is a comparison between the timing, and how long you hold down the jump button. \u200eWell timed jump - holding jump button \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eWell timed jump - pressing jump button \u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594 Poorly timed jump - holding jump button \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200ePoorly timed jump - pressing jump button Dash Replenish Crystals \u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594 [Other names: Diamonds, Refill Gems, Dash Crystals] A recurring mechanic that pops up in 'Celeste' are the green dash-replenishing crystals. If you collide with these crystals and you've used a dash, it will replenish it allowing you to essentially double-dash. Breakable Walls \u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594 In this chapter of Celeste, you may encounter a suspicious wall with cracks in it - this usually indicates a secret passageway to some collectable. When you see these walls, try dashing into them to reveal a secret. \n \n \n \n \n Chapter Map \n \n I've stitched together the map for chapter 1 in Prezi for anyone who wants to explore the map layout. You can drag to look around or press the right arrow button (&gt;) to be taken for a frame-by-frame tour. Hope it helps! \u2022\u1d17\u2022 \n \n \n \n \n Video Walkthrough \n \n Contains timestamps in the description for your viewing pleasure (\u25e1 \u203f \u25e1 \u273f) \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 1 \n \n [Not Missable] After the prologue - when you first start the level, head upwards to the next room and you will see strawberry 1. Jump onto the spring pad and dash towards the strawberry to grab it, making sure to touch the ground to collect the berry. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 2 \n \n [Not Missable] Head upwards into the next room from strawberry 1 and you will see strawberry 2. Drop down from the floating platform left of the strawberry to grab it, then dash upwards to climb back up and collect the berry. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 3 \n \n [Not Missable] Progress through the level until you come across a flying strawberry - strawberry 3. DON'T DASH as this will cause the strawberry to fly away and you'll have to retry. Jump onto the crumbling platforms then jump down to grab the strawberry, dashing upwards to land back on the platform and collect it. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 4 \n \n [Missable] In the room above the flying strawberry, head left towards the glow to find strawberry 4. Once inside the strawberry room: Head towards the platform in the middle of the screen covered in snow, dashing up onto the spring pad over the spikes, then dashing right to collect the strawberry. To exit and continue Exit the strawberry room the way you entered - to the right. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 5 \n \n [Not Missable] In the room above the flying strawberry you'll find strawberry 5. Use the traffic light lift to boost yourself up and grab onto the floating ice with spikes, jumping to dash onto the platform and collect the strawberry. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 6 \n \n [Missable] In the room above the flying strawberry, head to the bottom right of the room and you will see breakable ice - dash into the ice to break it, then enter the room to find strawberry 6. Once inside, jump down avoiding the spikes - then dash up-right onto the traffic light lift and ride it to collect the strawberry. To exit and continue Dash up-left towards the wooden platform with green algae and exit the way you came in - to the left. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 7 \n \n [Missable] From the first checkpoint - head left into a room with floor spikes and a green extra dash \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200ecrystal. Dash up-left falling into the crystal, then dash up-left again to get across the spikes. Head upwards to find the room with strawberry 7. BEWARE OF THE SPRING-PAD BELOW THE SPIKES! Avoiding the spring pad under the spikes, use the ( other) spring-pad to grab onto the first floating platform. Jump over the spikes dashing into the green crystal, then dash onto the platform to collect the strawberry. To exit and continue - Drop down to the left and say hello to Theo\ud83d\udc4b - From the room with Theo, head right to revisit the room with floor spikes and green crystal. - Head right again to continue from checkpoint 1. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 8 \n \n [Missable] Strawberry 8 is hidden - so from the first checkpoint, look to the right and you will see breakable dirt between two wooden platforms. Dash into the dirt and head inside to reveal the hidden strawberry. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 9 \n \n [Missable] Progress throughout the level until you enter the room with an up arrow sign, a horizontal lift, and a vertical lift. On the vertical traffic light lift, boost left of the arrow sign to unlock a secret passage. Dash onto the platform to the left and head through to the next room. Once you're in the next room: - Use the spring pad to dash up and climb up the wall. - Grab onto the traffic light lift to lower it, then quickly jump over the spikes. - Grab onto second lift and ride it all the way left, then climb into the nook above and wait for the \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200elift to pass. - Once clear, let go of grab, dash left and climb onto the wooden platform using the rest of your \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e stamina. - Head up and left into the next room - an open room with floating platforms. Head left, dashing across the floating platforms and you will come across strawberry 9 and the crystal heart location. To continue to the Crystal Heart Stay in the current room and continue with 'Crystal Heart' in guide. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To exit and continue - Head right over the floating platforms into the next room. - Head right again dropping down to the green sign, then heading up and right to drop down \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e from a crumbling platform. - Exit the way you came - to the right. \n \n \n \n \n Crystal Heart \n \n In the same place as strawberry 9, you will come across a small computer screen with flashing colours and colourful birds flying around. The birds represent directions to dash, and the colours on the computer screen represent the order you have to do it in. Therefore, to reveal the crystal heart you have to dash in the direction of the birds, in the order of colours on the screen. Once revealed, you have to dash into the crystal heart to collect it. [Directions you have to dash listed below] Screen with colour order 1. White 2. Purple 2. Blue 4. Red 5. Purple 6. Yellow Coloured bird directions Left [Purple] Up-Left [Yellow] Up [White] Up-Right [Red] Down-Right [Blue] To reveal the crystal heart you have to dash in the directions: \u2192 Up \u2192 Left \u2192 Down-Right \u2192 Up-Right \u2192 Left \u2192 Up-Left To exit and continue - Head right over the floating platforms into the next room. - Head right again dropping down to the green sign, then heading up and right to drop down \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e from a crumbling platform. - Exit the way you came - to the right. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 10 \n \n [Missable] In the room after the up-arrow sign, head to the top-left of the room and dash through the breakable ice. Here you will find strawberry 10 floating near the left wall. Once inside: Use the dash crystals to jump and grab the strawberry, then wait grabbing on the wall until the crystals replenish - using them to get back and collect the strawberry. To continue to strawberry 11 Stay in the current room and continue with 'Strawberry 11' in guide. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To exit and continue Exit the strawberry room the way you entered - to the right. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 11 \n \n [Missable] Strawberry 11 takes the same path as strawberry 10, so skip outlined paragraph below if you're following along. After the room with the up-arrow sign, head to the top-left of the room and dash through the breakable ice. Here you will find strawberry 10 floating near the left wall. To get to strawberry 11, jump onto the floating platform above and dash into the breakable ice in the middle of the roof - where you will be taken to another room. In the next room: - Climb up onto the wall to jump onto the crumbling platform, then to the vertical lift. - Use the vertical lift to boost up onto the falling floating ice, then quickly dash to safety. - Make your way to the next room which contains strawberry 11. Once you\u2019re in the strawberry room: - Dash onto the dirt platform. - Fall to grab the strawberry then dash right to collect the crystal, dashing up-right to land safely \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e and \u200ecollect the strawberry. To exit and continue Continue right once you've collected strawberry 11, where you will fall down a 1x1 crumbling platform. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 12 \n \n [Missable] In the screen after strawberry 11 or after the two floating and falling platforms (depending if you took the path of strawberry 11 or not) you will see: - Spikes on the floor - Floating ice with spikes - And green algae hanging down from a platform. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e [You are aiming for the hole in the floor under the wooden platform with spikes.] - Jump and climb the floating ice and dash onto the algae platform before the ice falls. - From the platform, fall towards the spikes below before quickly dashing right to fall down the \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200ehole. The room with strawberry 12 has three traffic light lifts with the strawberry floating near the right wall. Jump on each of the lifts without getting squished and grab the strawberry, then wait for the lifts to reset before jumping back to collect the strawberry. To exit and continue - Dash up the wider passage-way not surrounded by spikes where you'll be taken to a secret \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200enook in the previous room. - Jump on the spring-pad onto the crumbling platform, jumping back to safety. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 13 \n \n [Missable] In the same room as the floor spikes, floating ice platform, and green algae platform - head upwards through the hole in the roof to find the room with strawberry 13. Once inside: - Jump and climb to the top of the square traffic light lift (so you'll be able to make the jump) and \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200ewait until it stops before jumping off - as you'll die on the spikes. - From the square lift, jump onto the rectangle lift and ride it all the way left. Then jump left over \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e the spikes on top, falling to dash right grabbing the strawberry. To exit and continue Exit the same way you entered - from the hole in the floor. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 14 \n \n [Not Missable] Progress through the level and you will see strawberry 14. It will be surrounded by spikes in a nook at the top of the screen. I've found two ways you could do this depending on what you find easier: 1. Use the lift to boost yourself the right amount to grab the strawberry 2. Or to be safe - boost off the lift (pressing jump later) to boost below the strawberry, then dashing upwards to grab it without touching the spikes. Dash to the next screen to collect the strawberry, as standing on the lifts doesn't count. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 15 \n \n [Not Missable] In the room after strawberry 14, you will see strawberry 15. - Ensure the lift is in the stationary position. - Fall down towards the spikes and dash upwards to grab onto the right side of the lift. - Once the lift moves you towards the strawberry, you have to quickly jump, grab onto the wall\u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e to grab the berry, then quickly jump back onto the lift before it moves away. - As the lift slowly moves back, jump onto the wooden platform to collect the strawberry. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 16 \n \n [Missable] From checkpoint 2, head towards the pathway behind the lift. Grab onto the lift to move it out of the way, then quickly dash left to get behind it and head upwards. Once in the next room, continue left - dashing over the lift on the floor. - To make your way across the next room, dash left onto the spring-pad, then dash up to land\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e safely on the wooden platform above. - Fall left to land on the platform below with the green sign, then dash to climb onto the \u200e\u200eplatform \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eabove - heading left to find strawberry 16. You will see strawberry 16 at the bottom of the cliff - jump off to grab the strawberry then quickly dash up to climb up and collect the berry. To exit and continue - Head right, climbing up the left wall to land safely on the wooden platform - dashing right \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e towards the exit on the right. - Dash right over the lift on the floor and jump down the hole in the floor on the right. - Walk over the 1x1 crumbling platform above the traffic light lift to continue from checkpoint 2. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To continue to strawberry 17 and cassette Tape - Head right, climbing up the left wall to land safely on the wooden platform - dashing right \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e towards the exit to be in the room with the lift on the floor. - Continue with 'Cassette Tape' or 'Strawberry 17' in guide. \n \n \n \n \n Cassette Tape \n \n The cassette takes the same path as strawberry 16, so skip the outlined paragraph below if you're following along. From checkpoint 2, head for the path behind the traffic light lift. From the next room, use the lift to boost yourself upwards and head into the next room. There is a secret behind the lift in this room - grab onto the lift to move it out of the way then dash to get behind it to find the cassette room. Congrats you found the cassette room! In time with the beat, jump across the pink and blue platforms, then climb the left wall onto the traffic light lift and ride the lift all the way right to dash and grab the cassette. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 17 \n \n [Missable] Strawberry 17 takes the same path as strawberry 16 and the cassette tape, so skip outlined paragraphs below if you're following along. From checkpoint 2, head for the path behind the traffic light lift. From the next room, use the lift to boost yourself upwards and head into the next room. Once you find the next room, use the lift to boost yourself over the spikes and collect strawberry 17. To exit and continue Head down the hole to return to the lift on the floor we dashed over, then head down again to be back at checkpoint 2. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 18 \n \n [Not Missable] From checkpoint 2, use the lift to boost yourself over the chasm. Then from the outer small wooden platform, fall so you are under strawberry 18 and quickly dash upwards to climb up and grab the strawberry. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 19 \n \n [Missable] From checkpoint 2, use the traffic light lift to boost yourself over the chasm - continuing right to find the strawberry 19 room. Once inside DON'T DASH Fall down to the lift below to boost yourself right, landing on the crumbling platform and quickly climbing towards the spring pad. Use the spring pad to grab the strawberry, then dash to land on the platform and collect the berry. \n \n \n \n \n Strawberry 20 \n \n [Missable] Continue through the level until you enter a room with spikes sticking out of the floor and three loose ice platforms. If you look towards the top-left of the screen you will see a secret passage. Climb up the walls and grab onto the large ice block to the left to make it fall - quickly jumping to safety before it falls. Once the block has fallen, dash into the wall where the ice block once was - this will reveal the secret passage to the strawberry. Once inside the strawberry room: - Climb the wall to the right and dash up-left into the green crystal - continuing to dash until you\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e reach the end - Fall to grab the strawberry, then dash up-right into the green crystals until you land back to \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e safety. \n \n \n \n \n Outro \n \n Congrats!

In order to complete this challenge, players need to abuse the game's lenient hitboxes and \"coyote frames\" in order to perform very tight and difficult jumps. The player also has to learn a technique called \"neutral jumping\", which will be needed in a few sections towards the end. If the player manages to complete the chapter without dashing even once, a flying Golden Strawberry will appear on the last screen.\n\nUnlike all other Golden Strawberries, the player doesn't have to complete this chapter without dying in order to get it.\n\n## **Plot**\\[\\]\n\n**I tried to warn you.**\n\nThis section contains spoilers for Chapter 1: Forsaken City. Do not read the following section if you wish to avoid spoilers for Chapter 1: Forsaken City.\n\n[Madeline](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Madeline) travels through the titular Forsaken City, finding another hiker, Theo, about halfway through the level. Madeline and Theo converse, and Theo explains that he came to Celeste Mountain to explore and to take pictures, although Madeline avoids explaining why she came to Celeste Mountain. The two also discuss the origins of the Forsaken City, with Madeline explaining that a mega-corporation started building the city, but nobody wanted to live there, although neither of them know why. Madeline also expresses a desire to reach the summit of Celeste Mountain, something that Theo does not seem as interested in doing. Eventually, Madeline returns to climbing Celeste Mountain. At the end of the level, she encounters a memorial (entitled the Celeste Memorial), decides to stop there and make camp for the night, and goes to sleep, thinking that climbing Celeste Mountain might have been a mistake.\n\n**Show/Hide Content**\n\n## **Speedrunning Record Progression**\\[\\]\n\nOn 27 November 2018, Buhbai achieved 1:30 in City B, obtaining the first ever full sweep of a level.\n\nClear (1A):\n\n| Name | Time | Date | Days Standing |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Forsaken | 1:04.770 | 12/2/2018 | 11 |\n| Forsaken | 1:04.107 | 23/2/2018 | 12 |\n| Forsaken | 1:03.614 | 7/3/2018 | 62 |\n| DemoJameson | 1:02.662 | 8/5/2018 | 4 |\n| McBoi | 1:02.288 | 12/5/2018 | 14 |\n| McBoi | 1:02.135 | 26/5/2018 | 4 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:01.897 | 30/5/2018 | 8 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:01.166 | 7/6/2018 | 1 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:00.588 | 8/6/2018 | 5 |\n| Hornlitz | 1:00.095 | 13/6/2018 | 28 |\n| Hornlitz | 59.867 | 11/7/2018 | 81 |\n| Jumpyluff | 59.755 | 30/9/2018 | 6 |\n| Buhbai | 59.262 | 6/10/2018 | 147 |\n| UltraMarlin | 58.871 | 2/3/2019 | 17 |\n| FPlush | 58.514 | 19/3/2019 | 14 |\n| Zkad | 58.242 | 2/4/2019 | 9 |\n| Zkad | 58.089 | 11/4/2019 | 4 |\n| Zkad | 57.987 | 15/4/2019 | 30 |\n| FPlush | 57.868 | 15/5/2019 | 1 |\n| Zkad | 57.460 | 16/5/2019 | 23 |\n| FPlush | 57.103 | 8/6/2019 | 17 |\n| Zkad | 56.678 | 25/6/2019 | 99 |\n| Zkad | 56.644 | 2/10/2019 | 3 |\n| Zkad | 56.457 | 5/10/2019 | 4 |\n| Zkad | 56.151 | 9/10/2019 | 5 |\n| **Zkad** | **55.998** | **14/10/2019** | **127+** |\n| UltraMarlin\\* | 58.140 | 26/6/2019 | 0 |\n\n_Note_: World records prior to 12/2/2018 have been omitted due to extremely fast turnover.

Specific traps and items that appear in each level will be listed in the section for that level, but it is assumed that you are familiar with the basic controls in these descriptions.\n\nTraps and Tools in this level\n\n**Spikes**\n\n[![Celeste Spikes.jpg](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/e/ec/Celeste_Spikes.jpg)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Spikes.jpg)\n\n\\- Advertisement -\n\nThe idea of spikes is pretty obvious. If you touch them, they kill you. Don't touch them. Spikes can show up on the floors, the walls, or the ceilings - and sometimes on moving objects.\n\nDealing with spikes while going through this level is fairly simple and straightforward, but spikes are actually a somewhat complex hazard. There are places where you can hang off of the edge of a row of spikes where you would expect to die. You can also kick off of spikes at pretty much any corner. These advanced tactics are not necessary for getting through the Forsaken City, but can be used to eek out a little more speed in a speedrun, and for challenges such as making it through the City without ever dashing, [![Celeste Flying Gold Strawberry.png](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/9/96/Celeste_Flying_Gold_Strawberry.png)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Flying_Gold_Strawberry.png) which is part of the requirement for earning a special flying gold strawberry late in the game. It may also be necessary for getting through some puzzles in the B-Side and C-Side versions of the level.\n\nIf you're hanging on the edge of a wall with spikes on the floor next to you, if you jump in place and then jump again, you will kick off of the spikes, which will allow you to get a little extra distance on your jump.\n\n* * *\n\n**Springs**\n\n[![Celeste Springboards.jpg](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/6/64/Celeste_Springboards.jpg)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Springboards.jpg)\nWhen you step on a spring, it shoots you high up into the air. Be careful, as they can sometimes vault you into hazards such as ceiling spikes. Triggering a spring will restore your dash, as well as your stamina. Springs are typically on the floor, but can also be situated on walls. Hitting a spring on a wall will still restore your dash and stamina.\n\n* * *\n\n**Zippers**\n\n[![Celeste Gear Platforms.jpg](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/1/1b/Celeste_Gear_Platforms.jpg)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Gear_Platforms.jpg)\nWhen you touch a Zipper, it will move quickly from one side of the gears to the other, and then slowly return to its original position. The zippers can move up and down, side to side, or diagonally. You can see where the zipper will move by looking at the gears and belt in the background. The zipper will move from one gear to another. The zippers move at a hazardous speed, and can toss you into hazards if you're not careful. Occasionally these zippers can even have spikes attached to one side. Jumping while the zipper is in motion will add the speed momentum to your jump. This momentum boost applies if you are standing on the zipper, or if you're holding on to the side of the zipper. Jumping immediately after the zipper stops will still add the momentum to your jump. You must wait a few moments before you can safely jump from the zipper without adding the momentum of the zipper to your jump. Sometimes you want this extra momentum. You can use the zipper to shoot you up high, or vault you sideways across a gap. Other times, jumping too soon will result in being tossed into spikes or other hazards. There are traffic lights on the side of the zipper. Green means the zipper is moving. When the light turns yellow, the zipper has started moving back to its original position. Jumping while green results in a momentum boost. The light turns red when the zipper is in its original position and you are not touching it. Note that you can safely stand on a quickly moving zipper and the momentum will not throw you off, or slide you along the zipper when it comes to a sudden stop, so long as you don't jump. If you wish to ensure you don't add momentum coming off of a zipper, but need to get off the zipper while it's in motion, you can use your dash instead of jump. Momentum will never be added to a dash, even if done while on a moving zipper.\n\n* * *\n\n**Crumbling blocks**\n\n[![Celeste crumbling Platform.jpg](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20300%20169%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_crumbling_Platform.jpg) These blocks are weak and will crumble and fall when you land on them. You only have a second before you need to move on, or you will fall with the block. Landing on top of these blocks will still restore your dash and stamina. You can also grab the side of the block which will also cause it to fall, but grabbing the side will not restore your dash and stamina. When the block falls, a white dotted outline will be left in its place. The block will respawn after a few seconds. You can use the outline to keep track of its location, so you know where you'll be able to land when the block comes back. These blocks are sometimes used in tight passageways to create a one way passage. If you're on top of the block, it will crumble, allowing you to get below it. If you're beneath the block, you cannot jump up through it, so you cannot proceed up through this obstruction.\n\n* * *\n\n**Wood jump-throughs**\n\n[![Celeste Wood Platform.jpg](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/4/4d/Celeste_Wood_Platform.jpg)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Wood_Platform.jpg)\nWood jump-throughs allow you to jump up through them, but you cannot pass through them going downward. They are often used to create points of no return between areas where you'll jump up through a wood jump-through, but won't be able to return back down the way you came.\n\n* * *\n\n**Dash Crystals**\n\n[![Celeste Energy Crystal.jpg](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/c/c9/Celeste_Energy_Crystal.jpg)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Energy_Crystal.jpg)\nWhen you touch an dash crystal it will burst and will restore your dash and stamina. These crystals are invariably involved in some type of jumping puzzle, where you'll need to jump into them to restore your dash and then dash to safety (or to another dash crystal) before you land. Dash crystals will respawn after a few seconds.\n\n* * *\n\n**Falling Blocks**\n\n[![Celeste Loose Rocks.jpg](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/2/24/Celeste_Loose_Rocks.jpg)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Loose_Rocks.jpg)\nIn this level, falling blocks can be identified by their lighter color. They're covered with more snow than other blocks. In later levels, they simply look 'off'. When you grab or land on a falling block, it will wobble and then fall. Sometimes you need to knock a falling block down into place to solve a puzzle. Other times it's simply a timed platform that you only have a moment to land on before it's gone. Unlike the crumbling blocks, falling blocks do not respawn. They will only come back to their original position if you die or leave the area. Falling blocks often have spikes on top of them.\n\n* * *\n\n**Breakable Walls**\n\n[![Celeste Breakable Wall.jpg](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/4/4c/Celeste_Breakable_Wall.jpg)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Breakable_Wall.jpg)\nBreakable walls conceal secret paths that lead to collectibles. These blocks do not all look the same, and can be hidden in floors, walls, and ceilings.\n\nCollectibles in the Forsaken City\n\n[![Celeste Strawberry.png](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/2/2b/Celeste_Strawberry.png)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Strawberry.png) There are 20 Strawberries hidden in the Forsaken City. There are six in the starting area, 9 in the middle section, called the Crossing, and 5 in the final section - the Chasm. You can find these strawberries by looking at the maps provided, or by watching the Strawberry video.\n\n* * *\n\n[![Celeste Cassette.png](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/c/cf/Celeste_Cassette.png)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Cassette.png) The location of the B-Side Cassette is found near the beginning of the Chasm section - the final section of the Forsaken City\n\n* * *\n\n[![Celeste Crystal Heart.png](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/thumb/4/44/Celeste_Crystal_Heart.png/130px-Celeste_Crystal_Heart.png)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Crystal_Heart.png) The Crystal Heart for this section is hidden near the Satellite in the second section. You have to watch the color pattern being broadcast over the satellite. There are birds flying around nearby, and they fly out in various directions. You need to dash in the direction of the color of birds, following the color pattern broadcast by the Satellite. When you dash in the proper six directions the heart will be revealed.\n\n* * *\n\n[![Celeste Theo Forsaken City.jpg](https://cdn.staticneo.com/ew/0/06/Celeste_Theo_Forsaken_City.jpg)](https://www.neoseeker.com/celeste/File:Celeste_Theo_Forsaken_City.jpg) This is not really a collectible, but I'll list it here anyways. You have your first opportunity to meet Theo during the Crossing. This is an optional conversation that will introduce a character who will be pivotal to the story throughout the game. You don't unlock anything by meeting Theo, it's just an optional story interaction. Theo is a social media obsessed traveller who is constantly trying to get followers for his _Instapix_ account. If you want to help Theo in real life, you can find his instagram account at [\\[1\\]](http://www.instagram.com/TheoUnderStars/) [http://www.instagram.com/TheoUnderStars/](http://www.instagram.com/TheoUnderStars/). When I first found this account, Theo had 67 followers.\n\n### Forsaken City All Strawberries\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5IAG0qGspg?wmode=transparent&start=)\n\n### Forsaken City B-Side Cassette\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGSX_bWyPWc?wmode=transparent&start=)\n\n### Forsaken City Crystal Heart\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vt2oBbAIyCM?wmode=transparent&start=)\n\n### Level Maps\n\nNote that I've posted the maps in reverse order, so that they'll appear closer to the proper spatial order that you see them in the game. You start at the bottom and work your way to the top, so I posted the 'Start' map at the bottom.\n\nYou can click on the maps to get a closer view, and from there you may be able to zoom in even further with another click.\n\n* * *\n\n**Chasm** [![Celeste

It\u2019s not easy to 100% this game, but that\u2019s where we come in! Our strawberry guides aim to outline every single strawberry that you can find with images and the occasional video (for when it just gets too complicated to explain with words). So, let\u2019s get into it, shall we?\n\n### Strawberry \\#1\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 1](https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022716274900-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nFor this first strawberry, jump onto the spring button. Once you are airborne, veer off to the left so that you are directly underneath the strawberry and then dash upwards. This one may seem easy, but trust me, they get harder.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/01vmyxpt2xg?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#2\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 2](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022716300800-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nMake your way over to the right side of the screen. Drop down, and without using your dash, hold ZR and grab onto the lower part of the right wall. When you\u2019re ready, kick off from the wall, grab the strawberry and then use your boost to grab onto the wall that is parallel to the one that you just jumped from. Make your way back up by jumping from one side to the other until you are back up on the flat surface that you initially jumped off of.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBj4MXUFXeI?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#3\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 3](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022716333900-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nIn the next room, if you notice the sign that has an up arrow with a line through it, that means that if you try to jump and dash toward the strawberry from below, then it\u2019s going to fly away (who knew strawberries could fly\u2026). Instead, you have to make your way to the right of screen and jump from those platforms. But look out, they\u2019ll crumble if you\u2019re not quick enough. You don\u2019t have to use the highest crumbling platform, and instead just jump from the second highest platform and cling onto the wall of the floating island in the middle and climb up. From there, make your way to the other side, drop down and collect your strawberry.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/vH-CmQsdOGk?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#4\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 4](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022716370900-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nWhen you proceed upwards, take a left and you\u2019ll enter a side room with another strawberry. In this frame, make your way to the middle section and jump up to the first step. From there, jump and grab onto the wall on the right and then kick off and dash upwards to land on the wooden platform. Then, jump onto the spring and maneuver your way over the spikes and fall between the other spikes through that narrow gap. Be careful when you fall, because if you keep falling, you\u2019re going to land on the spikes down the bottom. What you want to do is use your dash at the last second and dash right to the strawberry and to safety.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Os87zotSN84?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#5\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 5](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022716422100-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nOnce you make it back to the frame that you were in before, you may think that there is no strawberry to collect. However, there is one in the top left hand corner waiting for you. What you want to do is stand on the conveyor belt platform, and as it shoots upwards, use that momentum to jump at the last second to propel yourself upwards. As you are airborne, move over to the left towards the floating platform and hang on to the right side of it for dear life. Climb up a bit and as you jump off, dash up-left and grab that strawberry.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWW-Ly9tDgQ?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#6\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 6](https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717173600-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nYou may think that you just need to proceed through to the top right of this section. However to get another strawberry, make your way to the **bottom** right of the frame and dash into the wall to uncover a hidden area.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 7](https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717173900-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nOnce you enter, you\u2019ll want to jump down and hang on to the wall on the left. Give yourself a bit of space to jump from it and hang on to the top-left side of the conveyor belt. As it moves, jump at the right time again and it will propel you over to the strawberry. To get back, just jump off to the left and dash up-left through the wooden platform in the middle of the frame.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_R9m6fT59M?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#7\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 8](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717210800-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nNow we\u2019ll make our way to the previous frame and go up. We will then be presented with this screen\u2026\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 9](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717222200-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nFirst off, head through the left exit into a room with a dash diamond. These diamonds will allow you an extra dash in mid-air. So jump off the platform and dash up-left, fall onto the diamond and dash again to safety. From here, you can go left and meet a main character, but to get the strawberry, we\u2019ll want to go up.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 10](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717241300-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nAs you proceed through this room, be mindful of the spring in front of you (it got me the first time). Jump over that and use the next spring to propel yourself upwards and veer off to the left a bit. Dash up-left over the spikes and collect the diamond, then dash up-left again onto the wooden plank. Now go grab that strawberry!\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydA_de92L5s?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#8\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 11](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717281800-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nGo back to the screen where we went left and make your way to the longer wooden platform on the bottom right of the screen. Dash into the wall to reveal another hidden area. Here is another strawberry!\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/YPzArQUgUpY?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#9\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 12](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717341400-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nMake your way through the next screen (as there are no strawberries here) and then you\u2019ll be in a room with two conveyor belt platforms. Now this part is tricky, so perhaps a little stretch before you attempt it may help\u2026\n\nSee that arrow above? Well that\u2019s where you want to go. Jump onto the first platform and propel yourself to the next one, but try not to go too far right as when that platform goes up, it\u2019ll squash you. As it propels you upwards, you want you\u2019ll want to jump to the left, then dash up-left and grab onto the wall to climb up onto the wooden plank. Jump and dash over to the left-hand platform and proceed.\n\nThis one requires you to be mindful of how long you hold onto the sides. Move forward and use the spring to propel yourself upwards and cling onto the right wall. Quickly move up and jump to the side of the conveyor platform. As it\u2019s about fall down, kick off it back onto the right wall and cling onto it again. When the conveyor platform is down, jump left and over the top of the spikes to land safely on the other side.\n\nNow, grab onto the right side of the platform and when it moves, jump and cling on to the right wall above it. When the platform moves back, move down and grab onto the left side of it. When it moves, you\u2019ll be able to make your way up onto a wooden platform. Make your way up to the top left of the screen, and proceed to the next frame.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 13](https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717423300-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nJump and dash from one platform to another and make your way to the strawberry next to the computer. And watch the pretty birds (ooh, pretty!). Actually, you really do need to watch the pretty birds, as this is how to get this chapter\u2019s Crystal Heart. We\u2019ll have our full Crystal Heart guide up very soon.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/gS9NjlMTi5Q?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#10\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 14](https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717461000-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nGo back the way you came and in the next frame, go up and over just to drop down as the crumbling bricks fall.\n\nNow that you\u2019re back, jump into the hidden area that we found before (just above where the sign was), make your way up and through to the next frame.\n\nNow if you look closely at this one, you can see that there is a crumbly wall in the top-left hand corner of the frame (all those years of playing Zelda has finally paid off!). Jump onto the spring and dash onto the platform. Dash into the wall and reveal another hidden area.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 15](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717474400-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nThis strawberry looks pretty self-explanatory, but in case you can\u2019t figure it out, jump to the left and dash up-left, picking up the diamonds and dashing again until you get the strawberry. But don\u2019t be in a hurry to get back, you still need to be safe on land to be rewarded with the strawberry. Cling onto the wall and wait for the diamonds to reappear and make your way back to the entrance.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/WP4Vhg-HY8w?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#11\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 16](https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717525100-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\n**But wait, we\u2019re not done here yet!** Jump and grab onto the wall on the right, then jump and dash onto the floating island. Can you see the crumbling part in the wall? Dash up into it and proceed to the next area.\n\nThere are no strawberries here so proceed to the top right and through to the next frame.\n\n_There\u2019s_ your strawberry! Fall down, dash up-right, grab onto the dry wall and climb up it. Fall off the wooden platform to the right, collect the strawberry and dash between the spikes into the diamond. Dash again up-right past the spikes and there we go!\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4Rf8nEO0YA?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#12\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 17](https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717554500-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nIn this next room, dash onto the side of the ice platform. As it is about to fall, jump again onto the platform on the top left. Do a leap of faith to the right and dash onto the three stones hovering. Before they come crashing down jump and dash upwards and land on that tiny little wooden plank next to the traffic lights in the background. Make your way upwards and onto the next secret(ish) area.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 18](https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717572700-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nJump and grab onto the left side of the conveyor platform, but be sure not to jump off of it until it completely stops (otherwise you\u2019ll be projected up into the spikes at the top). Jump off to the left and grab onto the right side of the other conveyor platform. When that stops, jump over it to the left and dash right (or grab onto the wall to the left and jump right over the spikes) just before you\u2019re about to hit the spikes.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/rnOqvdTjPPE?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#13\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 17](https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022717554500-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nNow make your way back to the previous frame, but do not move on as we are not done here yet! Do you see that tiny little gap at the bottom of the screen? Yep, that\u2019s where you want to go! Jump down onto the three crumbling stones, jump to the left and time your dash to the right perfectly.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 18](https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022718032400-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nNow this hidden area is all about quick movement! Jump off the wooden plank onto the first conveyor platform. Before that one shoots up, jump to the next one, then the next one, and then get the strawberry and cling on to the wall. Wait for the platforms to come back down and do the same thing to the left of screen. Make your way back up to the previous frame, use the spring to jump up onto the stones, dash up to the plank and move onward to the next frame.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/3AUYRszDJ3U?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#14\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 13](https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018022718061300-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nNow this next one is tricky, so we added a video below to show you. But to put it into words, make your way down and cling onto the right side of the wall below you. Jump right and dash onto the conveyor platform. Move over to the right of the platform and as it shoots up, at the last second you want to jump slightly to the right and use that momentum to propel Madeline into that strawberry. _Don\u2019t use your dash_, because you\u2019ll need that for when you come down. Dash to the right onto the next conveyor platform and let that shoot you up through the spikes and onto the platform and to safety. _Phew!_\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/3xZyhH8n99E?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#15\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 14](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018022718120300-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nIn the next frame, the strawberry is in a very awkward spot. You\u2019ll need to be very quick and precise with this one, so try not to get discourage if it takes you three (or thirty) tries. Jump and cling on the left hand side of the conveyor platform. As it gets to the end, climb up to the right side of the wall just below the wooden plank. As the conveyor makes its way back, you\u2019ll need to drop down and cling onto the right side of it. It\u2019ll move back to the right again which you\u2019ll then need to jump off to get the strawberry. Cling onto the wall and jump back onto the side of the platform. When it starts to move back, make your way up and to safety.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKrVSdFWC2I?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#16\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 19](https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022718191900-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nProceed to the next frame and do you see that strawberry to the right of screen? Let\u2019s not worry about that one just yet\u2026 instead, jump off the first plank and dash up through the plank above. Cling on the the right side of that conveyor platform and wait for it to finish moving. Don\u2019t let it project you, but instead quickly jump up and over the spikes so that you\u2019re on the left hand side of it. Before it comes back to squish you, go left, jump up and proceed to the hidden area above.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 20](https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022718261500-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nIn this part, jump onto the middle of the conveyor platform and at the last second, jump and let it project you upwards through the spikes and then dash that last bit. Make your way to the left and up to the next frame.\n\nTo get that strawberry, you\u2019ll need to jump up, dash, and cling onto the side of the platform conveyor belt. But before making your way to that strawberry, there is ANOTHER hidden area that is revealed behind the conveyor platform that has this chapter\u2019s B-Side Tape. For info on how to get that, we\u2019ll have our guide up on B-Side Tapes very soon.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 21](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022718272500-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nNow, back to the strawberry! Jump, dash, and cling onto the conveyor platforform and jump off at the last second so that it flings you aaallllllll the way over to the other side.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pth-caAuurE?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#17\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 22](https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022718340400-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nNow jump down to the previous frame, but we\u2019re not finished with this side part yet. Make your way past the conveyor platform and go through to the left side of the screen. Jump and dash to the left onto the spring button. As that shoots you up, make your way to the left a bit and then dash again up through the plank and to safety. Jump down to the left and land on the small platform that has no spikes and a sign is that\u2019s pointing upwards. Jump off that platformto the left and dash up, cling on to the icy side of the wall and make your way up.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 23](https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022718363600-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nDown below in the next frame, you\u2019ll see a sweet sweet strawberry. Jump down and move to the right, making sure you do not use your dash to collect it as you will need it to come back up. Cling on to the side of the wall, kick back off of it and dash up back to safety.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEIfPiu21F0?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#18\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 19](https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022718191900-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nMake your way back to the frame with the conveyor platform and then go back down to where we initially started this adventure off the beaten path. Step onto the crumbling stone to the right and fall down in front of the conveyor platform. Cling onto it, project yourself over to the other side and cling onto the wall. pull yourself up onto the plank on the left hand side and take a nice deep breath. Jump up and to the left, make your way around to the right and dash upwards onto the other plank where the strawberry is.\n\n**To proceed, make sure that you go right before you go up, because once you go up, you cannot come back.**\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXqrwr0y7ms?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#19\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 24](https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022720103100-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411-1.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nIn here, you\u2019ll need to walk off the plank and land on the conveyor platform. Time the jump and leap over to the crumbling stones on the bottom right hand side of the screen. Jump and cling onto the right wall and make your way up to the right floating island. Use the spring button, collect the strawberry and dash onto the middle platform. Now jump your way back to the plank and proceed through to previous frame.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQxipWgjoRE?feature=oembed)\n\n### Strawberry \\#20\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 25](https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022718421800-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\n_NOW_ you can jump back up and make your way up to where the big plank is up the top. Proceed upwards\u2026\n\nJump to the right, dash up and cling to the wall without spikes on the left. Kick off from that wall, collect the diamond and dash onto the plank to the right. Jump and dash to the left and land on the middle platform. Now jump to the left and fall until you\u2019re just about to hit the spikes; before you do, dash to the left and cling onto the wall. Climb up and jump onto the little platform. Then proceed further upwards.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 26](https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022718441900-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nIn this frame, jump onto the spring button and cling onto the wall on the left. Make your way up past the spikes, jump to the right, dash and cling onto the left side of the conveyor platform. After it moves up, kick off and land on the crumbling rocks, then quickly jump to the left and dash to safety. Proceed to the left and then up.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 27](https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022718465300-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nIn this frame, jump onto the first step and the jump to the right. Dash upwards, cling onto the wall and climb upwards to the plank. If you cling onto the rectangle that seems a bit off, make sure to jump from it quickly as it\u2019ll fall after a few seconds. This is important to remember, as there are other ones just like it. There is a hidden area to the top-left, just behind the other odd-looking rectangle. Jump and cling onto it, let it fall but jump back to safety so that you don\u2019t go down with it. Now proceed through to the hidden area.\n\nJump and cling onto the wall on the right. Kick off and dash from one diamond to another, grabbing the last strawberry along the way.\n\n![Celeste Strawberry 28](https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022718541500-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nNow make your way back to the previous frame, make the rectangle fall again and jump and dash over to the floating island. Cling onto the right side of the rectangle and fall down with it. Jump and dash from it and proceed to the next room.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvMbUoWg_HY?feature=oembed)\n\nJump onto the spring button and cling onto the right side of the conveyor platform. Jump at the last second so that it projects you far to the right. Dash at the last second again and cling onto the left side of the other conveyor platform. When that shoots upwards, jump up at the last second and project yourself up to safety. Jump up through the upper plank, fall down and dash up-left, and then repeat over to the far left and proceed upwards. The cutscene will begin and we are done with Chapter 1 \u2013 Hooray!\n\n![Celeste Chapter 1 100%](https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018022721195400-75A32021BE3512D7AA96B2D72F764411.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1)\n\nChapter 2 shouldn\u2019t be too far away, so stay tuned for more!\n\nIf you found this guide helpful, or if you\u2019d like to check out some of our other content, considering liking our [Facebook Page](http://facebook.com/switchaboo).\n\n## Sign up for more like this.\n\n[Enter your email\\\nSubscribe](https://www.switchaboo.com/celeste-100-strawberry-guide/#/portal)",

After contact you must land to collect it. **(3/20 Strawberries)** If it gets away, turn off invincibility and kill yourself until you collect it. Turn it back on when you are done.\n- Go up one screen\n- Go left one screen\n- Dash up the middle, you can go through wood platforms, and then back down to reach the Strawberry. **(4/20 Strawberries)**\n- Go right one screen\n- Grab the Strawberry in the top left corner **(5/20 Strawberries)**\n- Go to the bottom right and dash in to a big square ice block (to break it).\n- Go right one screen\n- Grab the visible Strawberry to your right **(6/20 Strawberries)**\n- Go left one screen\n- Go up one screen\n- Go left one screen\n\n**Note:** _The green energy boxes can be ignored for most of the game with Assist Mode on._\n\n- Go up one screen (the thin path in the top left)\n- Dash to the left and you will find a Strawberry **(7/20 Strawberries)**\n- Go down one screen through the small path to the left of the strawberry\n- You can talk to the character but this is not mandatory\n- Go right two screens\n\n[![PIC 1](https://www.trueachievements.com/customimages/l/110984.jpg)](https://www.trueachievements.com/customimages/110984.jpg)\n\n- There is a brown wall between two wooden platforms that is actually a dirt block which can be demolished with a dash. Grab the hidden Strawberry. **(8/20 Strawberries)**\n- Go right two screens\n- Dash straight up until you can only go left, then go left one screen (not the way you came)\n- Grab (![cn_RT](https://www.trueachievements.com/images/controllerbuttons/Xbox%20One/cn_RT.png)) the wall with gears in it and it will move down. Do the same with the next one to your left.\n- Go left one screen\n- Dash to the left, past the birds, and grab the Strawberry near the television. **(9/20 Strawberries)**\n- The TV flashes colors that line up to the birds you see. The birds will all spread out in different directions at once (sort of like their own dash). They make almost a star shape. You need to match the color to the direction the bird is going before they all pause. Don't worry, the work is done for you below.\n\n**Note:** _For ease of knowing whether you did it right or not, I highly recommend jumping for any dash that involves a +_\n\nWhite, Purple, Blue, Orange, Purple, Yellow which equates to:\n\nUp, Left, Down + Right, Up + Right, Left, Up + Left\n\nThis puzzle will be used again in Chapter 6 so I wanted to properly explain it. After you've done the dash pattern a heart will appear, assuming you've done it right. Dash into it to collect the first **Crystal Heart** and unlock:\n\n[Pointless Machines](https://www.trueachievements.com/a246716/pointless-machines-achievement)\n\nCollect the Crystal Heart in Chapter 1\n\n![Pointless Machines](https://www.trueachievements.com/imagestore/l/0007031500/7031577.jpg)\n\n[2 guides](https://www.trueachievements.com/a246716/pointless-machines-achievement?showguides=1)![Offline Mode - These achievements require play in game modes that do not necessitate a connection to any online services.](https://www.trueachievements.com/sprites/flags/offline-gamemode-lg.png)![Single Player - These achievements can be obtained by a single player.](https://www.trueachievements.com/sprites/flags/single-player-lg.png)![Collectable - These achievements are obtained by exploring the game environment to find a set of unique objects.](https://www.trueachievements.com/sprites/flags/collectable-lg.png)\n\n- Go right three screens\n\n[![PIC 2](https://www.trueachievements.com/customimages/l/110985.jpg)](https://www.trueachievements.com/customimages/110985.jpg)\n\n- Break the ice block in the top left of this screen, then go left one screen\n- Grab the Strawberry and you are halfway done this level **(10/20 Strawberries)**\n- Break the roof, which is an ice block, and go up one screen\n- Go to the top right of the screen and go right one screen\n- Grab the Strawberry in the middle of the screen **(11/20 Strawberries)**\n- Go right one screen\n\n[![PIC 3](https://www.trueachievements.com/customimages/l/110986.jpg)](https://www.trueachievements.com/customimages/110986.jpg)\n\n- There is a small gap to the right of spikes and below some spikes on a wood platform.

When you stop, you should collect them all at once and the last one should result in a 1UP. You can exit the level after this is done. Restart the chapter if you collect too many, but ignore the winged strawberries. The video below shows the best path to take if you want to get the flying Strawberry. I found it easier to hold ![cn_RT](https://www.trueachievements.com/images/controllerbuttons/Xbox%20One/cn_RT.png) the whole time, cling to walls and plan my path before moving. Touching the ground for longer than a split second will result in you collecting one. This took me five tries and I skipped the flying strawberry (there are 20 in the level after all), but feel free to grab it if you like.\n\n![Guide for Celeste - Chapter 1 - Forsaken City video](https://ip.trueachievements.com/remote/img.youtube.com%2Fvi%2FeH1O1mAyQqQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg?width=640)\n\n_Video credit goes to horheristo_\n\n[1UP!](https://www.trueachievements.com/a246714/1up-achievement)\n\nGet a 1UP\n\n![1UP!](https://www.trueachievements.com/imagestore/l/0006854800/6854829.jpg)\n\n[2 guides](https://www.trueachievements.com/a246714/1up-achievement?showguides=1)![Offline Mode - These achievements require play in game modes that do not necessitate a connection to any online services.](https://www.trueachievements.com/sprites/flags/offline-gamemode-lg.png)![Single Player - These achievements can be obtained by a single player.](https://www.trueachievements.com/sprites/flags/single-player-lg.png)\n\n#### **Chapter 1 - B Side**\n\nCollectibles\n\n- Red Heart\n\n**Note:** _The B Sides are all very linear but I have included the directions anyway in case you get stuck._\n\n- Go up three screens\n- Go right one screen\n- Dash to the top right and go up one screen\n- Dash to the right and go up one screen\n- Dash to the right and go up another screen\n- Go right one screen\n- Go up one screen\n- Grab the contraption to send it down and then go up one screen\n- Go up one screen\n- Dash to the top right and go right one screen\n- Go right one screen\n- Go up one screen\n- Reach the tomb stone to find there is more to do.\n- Dash to the right and through the Red Heart to unlock an achievement and end the B Side.\n\n[Sever the Skyline](https://www.trueachievements.com/a246717/sever-the-skyline-achievement)\n\nComplete Chapter 1 B-Side\n\n![Sever the Skyline](https://www.trueachievements.com/imagestore/l/0007054600/7054695.jpg)\n\n[4 guides](https://www.trueachievements.com/a246717/sever-the-skyline-achievement?showguides=1)![Offline Mode - These achievements require play in game modes that do not necessitate a connection to any online services.](https://www.trueachievements.com/sprites/flags/offline-gamemode-lg.png)![Single Player - These achievements can be obtained by a single player.](https://www.trueachievements.com/sprites/flags/single-player-lg.png)\n\n**Note:** _C Sides cannot be completed until after you've collected all the blue/red hearts._\n\n**Video Walkthrough by [Tranierx](https://www.trueachievements.com/gamer/Tranierx):**\n\n![Guide for Celeste - Chapter 1 - Forsaken City video](https://ip.trueachievements.com/remote/img.youtube.com%2Fvi%2FQhmedQ2umS4%2Fhqdefault.jpg?width=640)\n\n[4\\.
