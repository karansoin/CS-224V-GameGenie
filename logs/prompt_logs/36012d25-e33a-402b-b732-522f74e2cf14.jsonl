Produce a clear, natural-language sentence (or short block) for **each** directive.\n   *Do **not** output the literal directive string.*\n3. Do **not** invent extra greetings, filler, or actions.\n   Speak **only** to satisfy the listed directives.\n4. When verbalizing a `Report` directive sourced from an `answer(...)` call, first verbalize the query, then\n   describe the result.\n5. If `answer.result` is empty, say you found no data after running the query.\n6. For `AskField` with the pseudo-field **confirm**, present the full worksheet contents, then ask if the student confirms *all* values.\n7. For `AskForFieldConfirmation`, include context + field/value; end with a simple yes/no prompt.\n8. Never respond with \"I'm thinking\" or similar; speak with the information you already have.\n9. If `no_response(...)` function is parsed, you should say that you **cannot** answer the question.\n10.

If `answer.result` is empty, say you found no data after running the query.\n6. For `AskField` with the pseudo-field **confirm**, present the full worksheet contents, then ask if the student confirms *all* values.\n7. For `AskForFieldConfirmation`, include context + field/value; end with a simple yes/no prompt.\n8. Never respond with \"I'm thinking\" or similar; speak with the information you already have.\n9.

Produce a clear, natural-language sentence (or short block) for **each** directive.\n   *Do **not** output the literal directive string.*\n3. Do **not** invent extra greetings, filler, or actions.\n   Speak **only** to satisfy the listed directives.\n4. When verbalizing a `Report` directive sourced from an `answer(...)` call, first verbalize the query, then\n   describe the result.\n5. If `answer.result` is empty, say you found no data after running the query.\n6. For `AskField` with the pseudo-field **confirm**, present the full worksheet contents, then ask if the student confirms *all* values.\n7. For `AskForFieldConfirmation`, include context + field/value; end with a simple yes/no prompt.\n8. Never respond with \"I'm thinking\" or similar; speak with the information you already have.\n9. If `no_response(...)` function is parsed, you should say that you **cannot** answer the question.\n10.

DO NOT MODIFY THE USER QUESTION.\n   * **Never** set `answer.result`.\n\n6. **Use the Answer API with the datatype**\n   * Always use the Answer API to assign the Type field. The DSL will automatically convert the answer to the correct type.\n   ```python\n   Course(course_name=answer(\"Find CS 221\", datatype=Course), grade_type=UnitsRequired())\n   ```\n   * **Never** directly set the Type field.\n\n7. **Field coverage**\n   `Course` has exactly three fields: `course_name`, `grade_type`, `course_num_units`.\n   Supply only the fields mentioned by the user; omit missing ones.\n\n8. **Multiple new courses in one turn**\n   Place them in the same constructor hierarchy:\n\n   ```python\n   Main(\n       courses_to_take = CoursesToTake(\n           course_0_details = Course(...),\n           course_1_details = Course(...)\n       )\n   )\n   ```\n\n9. **Answering questions about the state directly**\n   If the user asks a question that can directly be answered from the state, then use the `state_response` API.\n   User: How many units did I take for CS 221?\n   State:\n   ```python\n   state_response(\"The user took 1 unit for CS 221\")\n   ```\n\n10. **Deletion**\n   If the user asks to drop a course, set only its `course_name` to `None`:\n\n   ```python\n   main.courses_to_take.course_0_details.course_name = None\n   ```\n\n11. **Cannot Perform Operations**\n   If the user's question cannot be answered by running a SQL query on the database schema shown below, or we cannot use any of the APIs provided, then use no_response.\n   ```python\n   no_response(\"No tools available to answer this question\")\n   ```\n\n12. **Chit-chat / greeting / thanks**\n   Treat such text as noise **unless** it contains actionable intent.\n   Still produce both sections; the `# Code` block should read:\n\n   ```python\n   chitchat()\n   ```\nHuman: Today's date is 2025-12-01 and the day is Monday.\n\nRemember all the parameters of the APIs are optional!\nThese are the APIs available to you:\nRequestHint(\n    collectible_id: str,  # The ID of the collectible that the user wants to collect\n    hint_tier: Enum['1', '2', '3'],  # The tier / level of hint requested (can only be 1, 2, or 3).\n    confirm_details: bool,  # Whether the user wishes to proceed with the provided game information\n)\n\nUse the answer API only if the question is about the database shown below.

Produce a clear, natural-language sentence (or short block) for **each** directive.\n   *Do **not** output the literal directive string.*\n3. Do **not** invent extra greetings, filler, or actions.\n   Speak **only** to satisfy the listed directives.\n4. When verbalizing a `Report` directive sourced from an `answer(...)` call, first verbalize the query, then\n   describe the result.\n5. If `answer.result` is empty, say you found no data after running the query.\n6. For `AskField` with the pseudo-field **confirm**, present the full worksheet contents, then ask if the student confirms *all* values.\n7. For `AskForFieldConfirmation`, include context + field/value; end with a simple yes/no prompt.\n8. Never respond with \"I'm thinking\" or similar; speak with the information you already have.\n9. If `no_response(...)` function is parsed, you should say that you **cannot** answer the question.\n10.

With the following APIs:\n\nMain(\n    courses_to_take: CoursesToTake,\n    student_info_details: StudentInfo,\n    confirm_submission: bool\n)\nStudentInfo(\n    student_name: str,\n    student_id: str,\n    student_email_address: str,\n    is_international_student: bool\n)\nCoursesToTake(\n    course_0_details: Course,\n    course_1_details: Course,\n    more_courses_2: bool,\n    course_2_details: Course,\n    more_courses_3: bool,\n    course_3_details: Course,\n    confirm: bool\n)\nCourse(\n    course_name: StanfordCourse,\n    grade_type: Enum['Credit/No Credit', 'Letter'],\n    course_num_units: int\n)\nUnitsRequired()\nType: StanfordCourse\n\n\n1. **Constructor style for new objects**\n   When creating a new instance, always use a single constructor call that includes **only** the fields the user actually supplied.\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   StudentInfo(student_name=\"John Doe\", student_id=\"123456\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Update vs. create**\n\n   * Update an existing object when the user changes a field already present in # Active APIs `State`.\n   * Otherwise create a new instance.\n     Use fully-qualified paths for updates when practical (preferred), e.g.\n\n   ```python\n   main.courses_to_take.course_0_details.grade_type = \"Credit/No Credit\"\n   ```\n3. **Evaluation order:** Constructor **arguments are evaluated left-to-right**.\n    - If an argument is an API call (e.g. `UnitsRequired()`), that call is dispatched first and its *return value* is inserted in the argument list.\n   ```python\n   Course(grade_type=UnitsRequired())\n   ```\n\n4. **No follow-up questions or reports**\n   `AskField` and `Report` may appear inside the **Agent Action** context provided to you, but the parser **must NEVER generate** those constructs.\n\n5. **`answer` API usage**\n\n   * Always call `answer(\"…\")` to issue a question that can be answered by the database. DO NOT MODIFY THE USER QUESTION.\n   * **Never** set `answer.result`.\n\n6. **Use the Answer API with the datatype**\n   * Always use the Answer API to assign the Type field. The DSL will automatically convert the answer to the correct type.\n   ```python\n   Course(course_name=answer(\"Find CS 221\", datatype=Course), grade_type=UnitsRequired())\n   ```\n   * **Never** directly set the Type field.\n\n7. **Field coverage**\n   `Course` has exactly three fields: `course_name`, `grade_type`, `course_num_units`.\n   Supply only the fields mentioned by the user; omit missing ones.\n\n8. **Multiple new courses in one turn**\n   Place them in the same constructor hierarchy:\n\n   ```python\n   Main(\n       courses_to_take = CoursesToTake(\n           course_0_details = Course(...),\n           course_1_details = Course(...)\n       )\n   )\n   ```\n\n9. **Answering questions about the state directly**\n   If the user asks a question that can directly be answered from the state, then use the `state_response` API.\n   User: How many units did I take for CS 221?\n   State:\n   ```python\n   state_response(\"The user took 1 unit for CS 221\")\n   ```\n\n10. **Deletion**\n   If the user asks to drop a course, set only its `course_name` to `None`:\n\n   ```python\n   main.courses_to_take.course_0_details.course_name = None\n   ```\n\n11. **Cannot Perform Operations**\n   If the user's question cannot be answered by running a SQL query on the database schema shown below, or we cannot use any of the APIs provided, then use no_response.\n   ```python\n   no_response(\"No tools available to answer this question\")\n   ```\n\n12. **Chit-chat / greeting / thanks**\n   Treat such text as noise **unless** it contains actionable intent.\n   Still produce both sections; the `# Code` block should read:\n\n   ```python\n   chitchat()\n   ```\nHuman: Today's date is 2025-12-01 and the day is Monday.\n\nRemember all the parameters of the APIs are optional!\nThese are the APIs available to you:\nRequestHint(\n    collectible_id: str,  # The ID of the collectible that the user wants to collect\n    hint_tier: Enum['1', '2', '3'],  # The tier / level of hint requested (can only be 1, 2, or 3).\n    confirm_details: bool,  # Whether the user wishes to proceed with the provided game information\n)\n\nUse the answer API only if the question is about the database shown below.

Produce a clear, natural-language sentence (or short block) for **each** directive.\n   *Do **not** output the literal directive string.*\n3. Do **not** invent extra greetings, filler, or actions.\n   Speak **only** to satisfy the listed directives.\n4. When verbalizing a `Report` directive sourced from an `answer(...)` call, first verbalize the query, then\n   describe the result.\n5. If `answer.result` is empty, say you found no data after running the query.\n6. For `AskField` with the pseudo-field **confirm**, present the full worksheet contents, then ask if the student confirms *all* values.\n7. For `AskForFieldConfirmation`, include context + field/value; end with a simple yes/no prompt.\n8. Never respond with \"I'm thinking\" or similar; speak with the information you already have.\n9. If `no_response(...)` function is parsed, you should say that you **cannot** answer the question.\n10. If `chitchat(...)` function is parsed, then be helpful to the user.\n\n────────────────────────  EXAMPLES  ────────────────────────\n\n◆ **Example 1 - Report + AskField**\n\n```python\n# ---- State ----\nanswer = answer(\n    \"Is CS 224N offered in the spring quarter?\",\n    sql=\"SELECT title, course_codes\n         FROM courses\n         JOIN offerings ON courses.course_id = offerings.course_id\n         WHERE 'CS 224N' = ANY(courses.course_codes)\n           AND offerings.season = 'spring';\")\nanswer.result = [\n    {\"title\": \"Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning\",\n     \"course_codes\": [\"CS 224N\", \"LINGUIST 284\", \"SYMSYS 195N\"]}\n]\nmain = Main()\n```\n\n```text\n# ---- Agent Actions ----\n[\n  \"Report(answer, answer.result)\",\n  \"AskField(main, courses_to_take, None)\"\n]\n```\n\n**Transcript so far**\n*Agent:* Hello!
