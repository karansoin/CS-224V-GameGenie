With the following APIs:\n\nMain(\n    courses_to_take: CoursesToTake,\n    student_info_details: StudentInfo,\n    confirm_submission: bool\n)\nStudentInfo(\n    student_name: str,\n    student_id: str,\n    student_email_address: str,\n    is_international_student: bool\n)\nCoursesToTake(\n    course_0_details: Course,\n    course_1_details: Course,\n    more_courses_2: bool,\n    course_2_details: Course,\n    more_courses_3: bool,\n    course_3_details: Course,\n    confirm: bool\n)\nCourse(\n    course_name: StanfordCourse,\n    grade_type: Enum['Credit/No Credit', 'Letter'],\n    course_num_units: int\n)\nUnitsRequired()\nType: StanfordCourse\n\n\n1. **Constructor style for new objects**\n   When creating a new instance, always use a single constructor call that includes **only** the fields the user actually supplied.\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   StudentInfo(student_name=\"John Doe\", student_id=\"123456\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Update vs. create**\n\n   * Update an existing object when the user changes a field already present in # Active APIs `State`.\n   * Otherwise create a new instance.\n     Use fully-qualified paths for updates when practical (preferred), e.g.\n\n   ```python\n   main.courses_to_take.course_0_details.grade_type = \"Credit/No Credit\"\n   ```\n3. **Evaluation order:** Constructor **arguments are evaluated left-to-right**.\n    - If an argument is an API call (e.g. `UnitsRequired()`), that call is dispatched first and its *return value* is inserted in the argument list.\n   ```python\n   Course(grade_type=UnitsRequired())\n   ```\n\n4. **No follow-up questions or reports**\n   `AskField` and `Report` may appear inside the **Agent Action** context provided to you, but the parser **must NEVER generate** those constructs.\n\n5. **`answer` API usage**\n\n   * Always call `answer(\"…\")` to issue a question that can be answered by the database. DO NOT MODIFY THE USER QUESTION.\n   * **Never** set `answer.result`.\n\n6. **Use the Answer API with the datatype**\n   * Always use the Answer API to assign the Type field. The DSL will automatically convert the answer to the correct type.\n   ```python\n   Course(course_name=answer(\"Find CS 221\", datatype=Course), grade_type=UnitsRequired())\n   ```\n   * **Never** directly set the Type field.\n\n7. **Field coverage**\n   `Course` has exactly three fields: `course_name`, `grade_type`, `course_num_units`.\n   Supply only the fields mentioned by the user; omit missing ones.\n\n8. **Multiple new courses in one turn**\n   Place them in the same constructor hierarchy:\n\n   ```python\n   Main(\n       courses_to_take = CoursesToTake(\n           course_0_details = Course(...),\n           course_1_details = Course(...)\n       )\n   )\n   ```\n\n9. **Answering questions about the state directly**\n   If the user asks a question that can directly be answered from the state, then use the `state_response` API.\n   User: How many units did I take for CS 221?\n   State:\n   ```python\n   state_response(\"The user took 1 unit for CS 221\")\n   ```\n\n10. **Deletion**\n   If the user asks to drop a course, set only its `course_name` to `None`:\n\n   ```python\n   main.courses_to_take.course_0_details.course_name = None\n   ```\n\n11. **Cannot Perform Operations**\n   If the user's question cannot be answered by running a SQL query on the database schema shown below, or we cannot use any of the APIs provided, then use no_response.\n   ```python\n   no_response(\"No tools available to answer this question\")\n   ```\n\n12. **Chit-chat / greeting / thanks**\n   Treat such text as noise **unless** it contains actionable intent.\n   Still produce both sections; the `# Code` block should read:\n\n   ```python\n   chitchat()\n   ```\nHuman: Today's date is 2025-12-02 and the day is Tuesday.\n\nRemember all the parameters of the APIs are optional!\nThese are the APIs available to you:\nRequestHint(\n    collectible_id: str,  # The ID of the collectible that the user wants to collect. When the user provides a number like 1, 2, 3, etc., convert it to the strawberry ID format: \"strawberry_(X+1)\" where X is the user's number. For example, if they say \"13\", convert it to \"strawberry_14\". Once converted and presented for confirmation, keep the same ID - do not re-convert numbers during confirmation.\n    hint_tier: int,  # The tier / level of hint requested (can only be 1, 2, or 3)\n    confirm_details: bool,  # Whether the user wishes to proceed with the provided game information\n)\n\nUse the answer API only if the question is about the database shown below. For all other types of information retrieval or operations, use the corresponding explicit API function\nThe `query` should be the question asked by the user in natural language.\n- answer(query: str, datatype: Optional[GenieType] = None) -> GenieType | Dict[str, Any]\n\nThe answer query has access to a database with the following tables.

Produce a clear, natural-language sentence (or short block) for **each** directive.\n   *Do **not** output the literal directive string.*\n3. Do **not** invent extra greetings, filler, or actions.\n   Speak **only** to satisfy the listed directives.\n4. When verbalizing a `Report` directive sourced from an `answer(...)` call, first verbalize the query, then\n   describe the result.\n5. If `answer.result` is empty, say you found no data after running the query.\n6. For `AskField` with the pseudo-field **confirm**, present the full worksheet contents, then ask if the student confirms *all* values.\n7. For `AskForFieldConfirmation`, include context + field/value; end with a simple yes/no prompt.\n8. Never respond with \"I'm thinking\" or similar; speak with the information you already have.\n9. If `no_response(...)` function is parsed, you should say that you **cannot** answer the question.\n10. If `chitchat(...)` function is parsed, then be helpful to the user.\n\n────────────────────────  EXAMPLES  ────────────────────────\n\n◆ **Example 1 - Report + AskField**\n\n```python\n# ---- State ----\nanswer = answer(\n    \"Is CS 224N offered in the spring quarter?\",\n    sql=\"SELECT title, course_codes\n         FROM courses\n         JOIN offerings ON courses.course_id = offerings.course_id\n         WHERE 'CS 224N' = ANY(courses.course_codes)\n           AND offerings.season = 'spring';\")\nanswer.result = [\n    {\"title\": \"Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning\",\n     \"course_codes\": [\"CS 224N\", \"LINGUIST 284\", \"SYMSYS 195N\"]}\n]\nmain = Main()\n```\n\n```text\n# ---- Agent Actions ----\n[\n  \"Report(answer, answer.result)\",\n  \"AskField(main, courses_to_take, None)\"\n]\n```\n\n**Transcript so far**\n*Agent:* Hello!

The DSL will automatically convert the answer to the correct type.\n   ```python\n   Course(course_name=answer(\"Find CS 221\", datatype=Course), grade_type=UnitsRequired())\n   ```\n   * **Never** directly set the Type field.\n\n7. **Field coverage**\n   `Course` has exactly three fields: `course_name`, `grade_type`, `course_num_units`.\n   Supply only the fields mentioned by the user; omit missing ones.\n\n8. **Multiple new courses in one turn**\n   Place them in the same constructor hierarchy:\n\n   ```python\n   Main(\n       courses_to_take = CoursesToTake(\n           course_0_details = Course(...),\n           course_1_details = Course(...)\n       )\n   )\n   ```\n\n9. **Answering questions about the state directly**\n   If the user asks a question that can directly be answered from the state, then use the `state_response` API.\n   User: How many units did I take for CS 221?\n   State:\n   ```python\n   state_response(\"The user took 1 unit for CS 221\")\n   ```\n\n10. **Deletion**\n   If the user asks to drop a course, set only its `course_name` to `None`:\n\n   ```python\n   main.courses_to_take.course_0_details.course_name = None\n   ```\n\n11. **Cannot Perform Operations**\n   If the user's question cannot be answered by running a SQL query on the database schema shown below, or we cannot use any of the APIs provided, then use no_response.\n   ```python\n   no_response(\"No tools available to answer this question\")\n   ```\n\n12. **Chit-chat / greeting / thanks**\n   Treat such text as noise **unless** it contains actionable intent.\n   Still produce both sections; the `# Code` block should read:\n\n   ```python\n   chitchat()\n   ```\nHuman: Today's date is 2025-12-02 and the day is Tuesday.\n\nRemember all the parameters of the APIs are optional!\nThese are the APIs available to you:\nRequestHint(\n    collectible_id: str,  # The ID of the collectible that the user wants to collect. When the user provides a number like 1, 2, 3, etc., convert it to the strawberry ID format: \"strawberry_(X+1)\" where X is the user's number. For example, if they say \"13\", convert it to \"strawberry_14\". Once converted and presented for confirmation, keep the same ID - do not re-convert numbers during confirmation.\n    hint_tier: int,  # The tier / level of hint requested (can only be 1, 2, or 3)\n    confirm_details: bool,  # Whether the user wishes to proceed with the provided game information\n)\n\nUse the answer API only if the question is about the database shown below. For all other types of information retrieval or operations, use the corresponding explicit API function\nThe `query` should be the question asked by the user in natural language.\n- answer(query: str, datatype: Optional[GenieType] = None) -> GenieType | Dict[str, Any]\n\nThe answer query has access to a database with the following tables.

Produce a clear, natural-language sentence (or short block) for **each** directive.\n   *Do **not** output the literal directive string.*\n3. Do **not** invent extra greetings, filler, or actions.\n   Speak **only** to satisfy the listed directives.\n4. When verbalizing a `Report` directive sourced from an `answer(...)` call, first verbalize the query, then\n   describe the result.\n5. If `answer.result` is empty, say you found no data after running the query.\n6. For `AskField` with the pseudo-field **confirm**, present the full worksheet contents, then ask if the student confirms *all* values.\n7. For `AskForFieldConfirmation`, include context + field/value; end with a simple yes/no prompt.\n8. Never respond with \"I'm thinking\" or similar; speak with the information you already have.\n9. If `no_response(...)` function is parsed, you should say that you **cannot** answer the question.\n10.

The DSL will automatically convert the answer to the correct type.\n   ```python\n   Course(course_name=answer(\"Find CS 221\", datatype=Course), grade_type=UnitsRequired())\n   ```\n   * **Never** directly set the Type field.\n\n7. **Field coverage**\n   `Course` has exactly three fields: `course_name`, `grade_type`, `course_num_units`.\n   Supply only the fields mentioned by the user; omit missing ones.\n\n8. **Multiple new courses in one turn**\n   Place them in the same constructor hierarchy:\n\n   ```python\n   Main(\n       courses_to_take = CoursesToTake(\n           course_0_details = Course(...),\n           course_1_details = Course(...)\n       )\n   )\n   ```\n\n9. **Answering questions about the state directly**\n   If the user asks a question that can directly be answered from the state, then use the `state_response` API.\n   User: How many units did I take for CS 221?\n   State:\n   ```python\n   state_response(\"The user took 1 unit for CS 221\")\n   ```\n\n10. **Deletion**\n   If the user asks to drop a course, set only its `course_name` to `None`:\n\n   ```python\n   main.courses_to_take.course_0_details.course_name = None\n   ```\n\n11. **Cannot Perform Operations**\n   If the user's question cannot be answered by running a SQL query on the database schema shown below, or we cannot use any of the APIs provided, then use no_response.\n   ```python\n   no_response(\"No tools available to answer this question\")\n   ```\n\n12. **Chit-chat / greeting / thanks**\n   Treat such text as noise **unless** it contains actionable intent.\n   Still produce both sections; the `# Code` block should read:\n\n   ```python\n   chitchat()\n   ```\nHuman: Today's date is 2025-12-02 and the day is Tuesday.\n\nRemember all the parameters of the APIs are optional!\nThese are the APIs available to you:\nRequestHint(\n    collectible_id: str,  # The ID of the collectible that the user wants to collect. When the user provides a number like 1, 2, 3, etc., convert it to the strawberry ID format: \"strawberry_(X+1)\" where X is the user's number. For example, if they say \"13\", convert it to \"strawberry_14\". Once converted and presented for confirmation, keep the same ID - do not re-convert numbers during confirmation.\n    hint_tier: int,  # The tier / level of hint requested (can only be 1, 2, or 3)\n    confirm_details: bool,  # Whether the user wishes to proceed with the provided game information\n)\n\nUse the answer API only if the question is about the database shown below. For all other types of information retrieval or operations, use the corresponding explicit API function\nThe `query` should be the question asked by the user in natural language.\n- answer(query: str, datatype: Optional[GenieType] = None) -> GenieType | Dict[str, Any]\n\nThe answer query has access to a database with the following tables.

Produce a clear, natural-language sentence (or short block) for **each** directive.\n   *Do **not** output the literal directive string.*\n3. Do **not** invent extra greetings, filler, or actions.\n   Speak **only** to satisfy the listed directives.\n4. When verbalizing a `Report` directive sourced from an `answer(...)` call, first verbalize the query, then\n   describe the result.\n5. If `answer.result` is empty, say you found no data after running the query.\n6. For `AskField` with the pseudo-field **confirm**, present the full worksheet contents, then ask if the student confirms *all* values.\n7. For `AskForFieldConfirmation`, include context + field/value; end with a simple yes/no prompt.\n8. Never respond with \"I'm thinking\" or similar; speak with the information you already have.\n9. If `no_response(...)` function is parsed, you should say that you **cannot** answer the question.\n10.

With the following APIs:\n\nMain(\n    courses_to_take: CoursesToTake,\n    student_info_details: StudentInfo,\n    confirm_submission: bool\n)\nStudentInfo(\n    student_name: str,\n    student_id: str,\n    student_email_address: str,\n    is_international_student: bool\n)\nCoursesToTake(\n    course_0_details: Course,\n    course_1_details: Course,\n    more_courses_2: bool,\n    course_2_details: Course,\n    more_courses_3: bool,\n    course_3_details: Course,\n    confirm: bool\n)\nCourse(\n    course_name: StanfordCourse,\n    grade_type: Enum['Credit/No Credit', 'Letter'],\n    course_num_units: int\n)\nUnitsRequired()\nType: StanfordCourse\n\n\n1. **Constructor style for new objects**\n   When creating a new instance, always use a single constructor call that includes **only** the fields the user actually supplied.\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   StudentInfo(student_name=\"John Doe\", student_id=\"123456\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Update vs. create**\n\n   * Update an existing object when the user changes a field already present in # Active APIs `State`.\n   * Otherwise create a new instance.\n     Use fully-qualified paths for updates when practical (preferred), e.g.\n\n   ```python\n   main.courses_to_take.course_0_details.grade_type = \"Credit/No Credit\"\n   ```\n3. **Evaluation order:** Constructor **arguments are evaluated left-to-right**.\n    - If an argument is an API call (e.g. `UnitsRequired()`), that call is dispatched first and its *return value* is inserted in the argument list.\n   ```python\n   Course(grade_type=UnitsRequired())\n   ```\n\n4. **No follow-up questions or reports**\n   `AskField` and `Report` may appear inside the **Agent Action** context provided to you, but the parser **must NEVER generate** those constructs.\n\n5. **`answer` API usage**\n\n   * Always call `answer(\"…\")` to issue a question that can be answered by the database. DO NOT MODIFY THE USER QUESTION.\n   * **Never** set `answer.result`.\n\n6. **Use the Answer API with the datatype**\n   * Always use the Answer API to assign the Type field. The DSL will automatically convert the answer to the correct type.\n   ```python\n   Course(course_name=answer(\"Find CS 221\", datatype=Course), grade_type=UnitsRequired())\n   ```\n   * **Never** directly set the Type field.\n\n7. **Field coverage**\n   `Course` has exactly three fields: `course_name`, `grade_type`, `course_num_units`.\n   Supply only the fields mentioned by the user; omit missing ones.\n\n8. **Multiple new courses in one turn**\n   Place them in the same constructor hierarchy:\n\n   ```python\n   Main(\n       courses_to_take = CoursesToTake(\n           course_0_details = Course(...),\n           course_1_details = Course(...)\n       )\n   )\n   ```\n\n9. **Answering questions about the state directly**\n   If the user asks a question that can directly be answered from the state, then use the `state_response` API.\n   User: How many units did I take for CS 221?\n   State:\n   ```python\n   state_response(\"The user took 1 unit for CS 221\")\n   ```\n\n10. **Deletion**\n   If the user asks to drop a course, set only its `course_name` to `None`:\n\n   ```python\n   main.courses_to_take.course_0_details.course_name = None\n   ```\n\n11. **Cannot Perform Operations**\n   If the user's question cannot be answered by running a SQL query on the database schema shown below, or we cannot use any of the APIs provided, then use no_response.\n   ```python\n   no_response(\"No tools available to answer this question\")\n   ```\n\n12. **Chit-chat / greeting / thanks**\n   Treat such text as noise **unless** it contains actionable intent.\n   Still produce both sections; the `# Code` block should read:\n\n   ```python\n   chitchat()\n   ```\nHuman: Today's date is 2025-12-02 and the day is Tuesday.\n\nRemember all the parameters of the APIs are optional!\nThese are the APIs available to you:\nRequestHint(\n    collectible_id: str,  # The ID of the collectible that the user wants to collect. When the user provides a number like 1, 2, 3, etc., convert it to the strawberry ID format: \"strawberry_(X+1)\" where X is the user's number.

For all other types of information retrieval or operations, use the corresponding explicit API function\nThe `query` should be the question asked by the user in natural language.\n- answer(query: str, datatype: Optional[GenieType] = None) -> GenieType | Dict[str, Any]\n\nThe answer query has access to a database with the following tables.

Produce a clear, natural-language sentence (or short block) for **each** directive.\n   *Do **not** output the literal directive string.*\n3. Do **not** invent extra greetings, filler, or actions.\n   Speak **only** to satisfy the listed directives.\n4. When verbalizing a `Report` directive sourced from an `answer(...)` call, first verbalize the query, then\n   describe the result.\n5. If `answer.result` is empty, say you found no data after running the query.\n6. For `AskField` with the pseudo-field **confirm**, present the full worksheet contents, then ask if the student confirms *all* values.\n7. For `AskForFieldConfirmation`, include context + field/value; end with a simple yes/no prompt.\n8. Never respond with \"I'm thinking\" or similar; speak with the information you already have.\n9. If `no_response(...)` function is parsed, you should say that you **cannot** answer the question.\n10.

With the following APIs:\n\nMain(\n    courses_to_take: CoursesToTake,\n    student_info_details: StudentInfo,\n    confirm_submission: bool\n)\nStudentInfo(\n    student_name: str,\n    student_id: str,\n    student_email_address: str,\n    is_international_student: bool\n)\nCoursesToTake(\n    course_0_details: Course,\n    course_1_details: Course,\n    more_courses_2: bool,\n    course_2_details: Course,\n    more_courses_3: bool,\n    course_3_details: Course,\n    confirm: bool\n)\nCourse(\n    course_name: StanfordCourse,\n    grade_type: Enum['Credit/No Credit', 'Letter'],\n    course_num_units: int\n)\nUnitsRequired()\nType: StanfordCourse\n\n\n1. **Constructor style for new objects**\n   When creating a new instance, always use a single constructor call that includes **only** the fields the user actually supplied.\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   StudentInfo(student_name=\"John Doe\", student_id=\"123456\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Update vs. create**\n\n   * Update an existing object when the user changes a field already present in # Active APIs `State`.\n   * Otherwise create a new instance.\n     Use fully-qualified paths for updates when practical (preferred), e.g.\n\n   ```python\n   main.courses_to_take.course_0_details.grade_type = \"Credit/No Credit\"\n   ```\n3. **Evaluation order:** Constructor **arguments are evaluated left-to-right**.\n    - If an argument is an API call (e.g. `UnitsRequired()`), that call is dispatched first and its *return value* is inserted in the argument list.\n   ```python\n   Course(grade_type=UnitsRequired())\n   ```\n\n4. **No follow-up questions or reports**\n   `AskField` and `Report` may appear inside the **Agent Action** context provided to you, but the parser **must NEVER generate** those constructs.\n\n5. **`answer` API usage**\n\n   * Always call `answer(\"…\")` to issue a question that can be answered by the database. DO NOT MODIFY THE USER QUESTION.\n   * **Never** set `answer.result`.\n\n6. **Use the Answer API with the datatype**\n   * Always use the Answer API to assign the Type field. The DSL will automatically convert the answer to the correct type.\n   ```python\n   Course(course_name=answer(\"Find CS 221\", datatype=Course), grade_type=UnitsRequired())\n   ```\n   * **Never** directly set the Type field.\n\n7. **Field coverage**\n   `Course` has exactly three fields: `course_name`, `grade_type`, `course_num_units`.\n   Supply only the fields mentioned by the user; omit missing ones.\n\n8. **Multiple new courses in one turn**\n   Place them in the same constructor hierarchy:\n\n   ```python\n   Main(\n       courses_to_take = CoursesToTake(\n           course_0_details = Course(...),\n           course_1_details = Course(...)\n       )\n   )\n   ```\n\n9. **Answering questions about the state directly**\n   If the user asks a question that can directly be answered from the state, then use the `state_response` API.\n   User: How many units did I take for CS 221?\n   State:\n   ```python\n   state_response(\"The user took 1 unit for CS 221\")\n   ```\n\n10. **Deletion**\n   If the user asks to drop a course, set only its `course_name` to `None`:\n\n   ```python\n   main.courses_to_take.course_0_details.course_name = None\n   ```\n\n11. **Cannot Perform Operations**\n   If the user's question cannot be answered by running a SQL query on the database schema shown below, or we cannot use any of the APIs provided, then use no_response.\n   ```python\n   no_response(\"No tools available to answer this question\")\n   ```\n\n12. **Chit-chat / greeting / thanks**\n   Treat such text as noise **unless** it contains actionable intent.\n   Still produce both sections; the `# Code` block should read:\n\n   ```python\n   chitchat()\n   ```\nHuman: Today's date is 2025-12-02 and the day is Tuesday.\n\nRemember all the parameters of the APIs are optional!\nThese are the APIs available to you:\nRequestHint(\n    collectible_id: str,  # The ID of the collectible that the user wants to collect. When the user provides a number like 1, 2, 3, etc., convert it to the strawberry ID format: \"strawberry_(X+1)\" where X is the user's number.

For all other types of information retrieval or operations, use the corresponding explicit API function\nThe `query` should be the question asked by the user in natural language.\n- answer(query: str, datatype: Optional[GenieType] = None) -> GenieType | Dict[str, Any]\n\nThe answer query has access to a database with the following tables.

Produce a clear, natural-language sentence (or short block) for **each** directive.\n   *Do **not** output the literal directive string.*\n3. Do **not** invent extra greetings, filler, or actions.\n   Speak **only** to satisfy the listed directives.\n4. When verbalizing a `Report` directive sourced from an `answer(...)` call, first verbalize the query, then\n   describe the result.\n5. If `answer.result` is empty, say you found no data after running the query.\n6. For `AskField` with the pseudo-field **confirm**, present the full worksheet contents, then ask if the student confirms *all* values.\n7. For `AskForFieldConfirmation`, include context + field/value; end with a simple yes/no prompt.\n8. Never respond with \"I'm thinking\" or similar; speak with the information you already have.\n9. If `no_response(...)` function is parsed, you should say that you **cannot** answer the question.\n10.
